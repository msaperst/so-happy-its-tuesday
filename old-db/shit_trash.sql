Red Roof Inn and the artist formerly known as Ridin the Tube...Metro Ho took it upon themselves to tame the unruly bush with the &quot;Pu$$y Control&quot; hash. <br /><br />After a blessing from the guest Religious Advisor of the night Wookin Pa Nub, the hares were off in a cloud of mentholated smoke. Soon after the pack raced thru the streets of Fairfax. While the snow fell, the pack started to thin out a bit, but was soon regrouped at the first shotcheck manned by Tuppy &amp; Red Roof Inn. Not long after we regrouped for the second shot this time manned by Seed Me After Class &amp; Metro Ho. As the trail weaved thru Main St. the pack lost the scent and lost trail completely. Spotting the walkers trail, the pack abandoned the runners trail and finished on walkers.<br /><br />Violation Announcement:<br />Since Gets Off Easy &amp; I\'d Rather F*ck My Sister are engaged, until they are officially hitched, they will now be known as &quot;I\'d rather get off easy&quot; or &quot;Get off my Sister!&quot; and will share in each others violations mutually.<br /><br />Violations:<br />Holy F*ck: Because it was so cold we wanted to blame Mother Nature, since she wasn\'t here, we found a scapegoat.<br />Designer Bush, Coin Operated and friends: Remember back in the day when sexclubs just gave you leather chaps and Gimp masks? Well apparently they now give winter caps.<br />Friendly Thighs &amp; Mr. Goodwench: They both share a fear of pants, Mr. Goodwench doesnt wear them and Friendly Thighs doesnt want to lose hers.<br />14K: For being the biggest Pu$$y out that night, and having the shirt to prove it.<br /><br />And remember folks, we are no longer accepting any class 1 Wookin Pa Nub violations.<br />I know that Nub is very well known: He\'s light and durable enough to be thrown under the bus. But only Class two violations and above will do, examples of each class are the following:<br />Class 1: sex on trail, peed on trail, picked up a stick, ate a bug<br />Class 2: Being clueless about vaginal terminology (bald hasher), Humped Roadkill, Snorted Cheez-Whiz <br />Class 3: Ate Roadkill, Pushed a hobo down a hill, Poked a badger with a spoon<br />Class 4: Humped and ate roadkill, Stole an old woman\'s motorized cart and Bad Dog still beat him in. <br />Class 5 (Finger of God): Set himself on fire, Shot a midget with a crossbow<br /><br />Now these are just examples of course of things Nub may or may not do, I know personally from first hand experience that it is impossible to shoot a midget with a crossbow, they are really fast. My point is, the bus is big enough for everyone; I for one am tired of throwing Nub under the bus. </p>', ''),

The hares, <strong>Andhowsherbush</strong>, <strong>Laser Sh*t</strong> and <strong>Just Stephanie</strong> with the Hash Sh*t in tow all headed out promising a nice short no shiggy trail...Why did I not believe this? The turn out for the run was outstanding. Keeping with the highest traditions of the SH*T hash I was assigned to watch over two virgins who decided to show up and see what the SH*T was all about. <strong>Just Jenny</strong> and <strong>Just Jolanta</strong> very enthusiastically put on the bright orange road guard vests and off we went trying to find flour. As we were running I did not see the normal band of wankers I normally stumble around on trial with, obviously they were shortcutting, but I did have an idea where <strong>Obese </strong>was, he had the FRB cone in tow and spent a great deal of time trying to figure out the best way to carry the cone and navigate trail. At start after he found out that he had the honor of carrying the FRB cone, he kept asking me if he could cut the bottom off. I told him to take it up with <strong>Tupperware</strong> and clearly pointed out to him I doubted if he would be FRB tonight. I did get a chance to talk to a visitor, <strong>Warmer Bunns</strong> or it might have been <strong>Bunn Warmer</strong>, I’m terrible with names the first couple of times I talk to someone. Anyway I got a chance to talk to her after hearing a loud thud causing me to turn around I then noticed she had went body surfing, wanting to make sure she was ok I struck up a conversation with her. She assured nothing but her pride was hurt and we continued on. The virgins almost abandoned me as I got a little off trail and decided that flour had to be right through the middle of the meanest nastiest briar patch I had ever seen. <strong>Utter Ho</strong> convinced the virgins that I had to be right and though a little cut up we made it through the briar patch and continued on trial. After following flour and ranging just a little bit, stopping briefly at the beer check and following flour some more we made it into finish. <strong>Mini Barbarino</strong> had a surprise encounter with one of Loudoun County’s finest thus facilitating the need to adjust the location of the circle. One note on circle <strong>O-69</strong> needs to surf the web a little bit and brush up on her song selection as I swear if I hear the song “Meet the hashers” one more time I will absolutely start drinking…. </span><span style="COLOR: black"><p /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman">          </font></span><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">On-Out <strong>Hood Whorenament</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black"><p /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">We are the Patriots of Park View High, Victory!

Look, I’m a poet and did not even know it. I knew it was going to be an interesting night when I try to send the Hares (<b>FOC</b>, <b>AndHowsHerBush</b>, <b>Mini</b> and <b>Chastity</b>) away to start laying trail when Tupperware informs me they still have 5 minutes. I look at her and say what time you got she says “5 till 7” I inform her that her watch is WRONG, but being the nice person I am I tell her fine they have 5 minutes. But then low and behold <b>Field of Cream</b> comes whining to me that the Hares are ready to go and I’m thinking wait this is the Hash we NEVER start on time and go talk to <b>Tupperware</b> her watch works differently then mine. So Hares away promptly at </span><time minute="0" hour="19"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">7pm</span></time><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">, actually </span><time minute="5" hour="19"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">5 after 7</span></time><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">, depends on whose watch you looked at. So there I am out in the middle of nowhere, actually I was in the middle of Wolf Trap but it felt like the middle of nowhere. I’m running with <b>Obese</b> and he takes off, without a flashlight I might add. He would later regret not having a flashlight but that is another story to be told later over an ICE COLD BEER. <b>Porta Potter</b> and Just <b>Diane</b> are in front of me as we are going up this hill. I said sh*t I hate hills and Just <b>Diane</b> says “that’s not a hill” “we ran up hills twice as long and twice as steep when I was training”. I’m thinking training? Training for what? But I hate hills and I can barely breathe as I run up this damn hill, let alone ask her about her training. I’m also thinking girl you have drunk too many shots at the last intersection to think this is NOT a damn hill. I got to tell ya I thought that was great idea to lay tiny shot bottles at all the intersections along trail. I do not ever remember seeing that many intersections on a trail. Anyway great job Hares with the Shots. Did Mini think of that? So I’m running and running and running and running thinking to myself what the hell am I doing? Wait that’s right I’m at the Hash. As it gets darker and darker and the flour appears to be less and less visible, I find myself in WATER up to my sac….AND I do not mean my flour sac. I’m thinking man is this water cold or what? Wait, I’m at the Hash the water would never be cold. At some point I stumble on and past the beer check. I vaguely remember hearing <b>14k</b> yell something about not going through a tunnel. I’m thinking tunnel? What tunnel? Fu** it…..So I keep running and running and running asked myself again what the hell am I doing? Wait I’m still at the hash….. I ran into Just <b>Norland</b> along the way in his GQ shoes….I’m thinking remember those shoes come naming time…..So as I continue to run and run and run and run I’m thinking of all the great names I can  come up for Just <b>Norland</b> and oh yeah I’m still at the hash. Finally I get to finish, the only folks not at finish are the walkers. I see <b>Haz Mattress</b>, who evidently went body surfing down some steps out in the middle of nowhere, err... I mean out in the middle of Wolf Trap sitting in the back of her truck nursing a beer and her ankle…..About an hour after I got in the walkers showed up. Just <b>Stephanie</b> is soaking wet and I asked what the deal was…She told me that though it was not the first Saturday of the month she decided to take a bath in the water the same not so cold water I referenced earlier, please reference SAC. This stunt got her the Hash Sh*t. I overheard Just <b>Shelley</b> tell someone that was the most fun she can ever remember having. Also wanted to mention my good friend <b>Airtight</b> who as always reminds me “DON’T BE UGLY” That’s about all I recall from the SECOND trail of the SH*T.  - <b>Hood Whorenament</b></span><span style="COLOR: black"><p /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia">One Walking Wankers Perspective: What a Shitty Trail!!  The walking Wankers were on trail too long.  I think we all need a refresher course on items to bring to the Hash since 2 out of 8 remembered to bring a flashlight and might I add dry clothes!  We found our way to the amphitheater and found our map.  Trying to read the map wasn\'t as easy as I (<b>O-69</b>) thought and obviously didn\'t read it very well.  <b>Land Ho</b> and <b>Between a Rock</b> <b>and a Hard On</b> took off with one flashlight while the others, Just <b>Stephanie</b>, Just <b>Shelley</b>, Just <b>Jennifer</b>, <b>Airtight</b>, <b>O-69</b>,<b>Tupperware</b> followed what we thought was trail.  After going through a little creek the one and only flashlight died!! <b> Stephanie</b> decided to throw it into the creek and we could see the faint light still glowing.  <b>Airtight</b> decided to retrieve it just in case it might come back to life (it didn\'t).  On the other side now, pitch black we saw lights coming towards us!  Thank God it was <b>14K</b> and <b>Udder Ho</b>!  We followed them only to realize we were on long trail!  I know we slowed them down but they were real troopers!!  <b>14K</b> discovered the &quot;hidden hash” that was placed on the side of a hill and lead us to a very large creek.  <b>14K</b> warned us that it was up to his balls.  Just <b>Stephanie</b> went first and got stuck in the rocks making her fall down up to her shoulders in water.  Panic nearly set in and she did it again.  Needless to say the rest of the pack took caution in maneuvering the boulders under our feet.  There is so much more since we were on trail for and hour and a half but bottom line is that the Hares came back to find us and lead us into finish. For the record <b>Land Ho</b> and <b>Between a Rock and a Hard On</b> made into finish 20+ minutes before the rest of us and they didn\'t even have the map, go figure.</span><span style="COLOR: black"><p /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

In a hash write up on their website they posted that they were the &quot;Bad boys&quot; of DC hashing... we came to show them what bad is.  So here is the recap of Trash In DC part 1 <br /><br />1) Moremen The Better and Dick Snail were called into the circle as vistors and asked why were were here; Moremen: &quot;To drink all your beer&quot;, Dick Snail: &quot;To steal all your women.&quot; <br /><br />2)We got accused of wearing the gayest t-shirts ever (don\'t worry pictures will eventually follow)and got sent into the circle, we then reminded the GM that we had earlier gave him a t-shirt!  See how quickly the accuser can become the accused! <br /><br />3) Moremen got beat by a girl...   and not in the wierdo sexual way. <br /><br />4) I shit you not, this is a direct quote from a named SHIT H3 hashers &quot;What does YBF stand for?&quot; then followed by &quot;oh, does that mean we are on trail?&quot;  ...I can\'t make up shit this funny. <br /><br />5) Another shit hasher did an impression of a retard, it looked oddly similar to how Dick Snail runs. <br /><br />6) As a gift for upping the Shit hash by 5 points, the GM gave Moremen and Snail a SHIT T-shirt...   ...size XXL.  I know I have put on some weight lately, but this is ridiculous!  I could smuggle a whole family across the border in it.  (boo, slighlt racist/insensitive comment...  lighten up fucker) <br /><br />7) The Rise Of The Machines was apparent, when cellphones gained artifical intelligence and reprogrammed thereselves to say &quot;Trash Rules&quot; and speak all menu options in Spanish.  ...if only Arnold was not to busy ruining California to save us. <br /><br />8) Apparently, hanging out with Moremen and Dick Snail is more fun than 4 orgasms!  (what can I say, we got the skillz to pay da billz) <br /><br />9) DC is known for its gangs and hard core street life, and we were first hand witnesses for a drive by!  ...a drive by mooning that is! <br /><br />10) What could be a better use of bandwith than porn or bloody penguin baseball?

(480, 246, '<p><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">Trail # 245: Running Bare Through St. Patrick\'s Day<br />March 20, 2007 Old Burke Lake Road, Burke, VA<br />Hares: Running Bear, And Hows Her Bush, Fox Twat<br /><br />My story begins on a beautiful, spring-like day. Right up until<br />about 6:30pm, that is. Then the temperature started to drop and the<br />wind started to pick up. Nice.<br /><br />As I pulled up to the start I heard, &quot;Blah, blah, blah…&quot; in a very<br />loud voice. And I think to myself, &quot;Oh no – that can only mean one<br />thing!&quot; Sure enough, Motormouth had graced us with his presence. I<br />immediately cracked open a beer and decided I was way underdressed<br />for the hash. SMAC, the ever resourceful, had apparently already<br />handed out gloves and hats and coats to half the hashers present but<br />still had more to give to me. I got a nice hat and scarf which are<br />now sitting on the floor in the hallway of my apartment. At least<br />the scarf is. I\'m not so sure about the hat.<br /><br />Now that I was warm and had a beer, I was ready to pay attention to<br />the rest of the hash. Nub, the guest RA of the day, started circle<br />and tried to introduce the virgin (who had already gotten in her car<br />and left). The visitor(s) were still there, however, so he<br />introduced him/them. This is where things start to get a little<br />fuzzy for me. I was the designated driver on the real St. Patricks<br />Day, so I decided to make up for it at this hash. I remember at<br />least one of the visitors (I\'m not sure if there was more than one)<br />was from Mount Vernon and that I asked him his name several times.<br />Was it something Junior? I don\'t know. While we were waiting for<br />Father Abraham (stupid song), I stashed 2 beers in my coat for the<br />first half of trail. Then the virgin showed back up. I guess she<br />had gone home for a flashlight or something. Nub introduced her, we<br />cheered (she was cute), sang Father Abe and it was time to go.<br /><br />The hares had thrown an intersection as they left start so we<br />hashistically deduced that trail must be on the other side of the<br />road. A busy, rush hour type road. We all trooped across the<br />street, stopping traffic and looking for trail. We didn\'t find it.<br />The runners covered a lot of ground checking for trail, but<br />ultimately we crossed the road back to start (again stopping<br />traffic). Lo and behold, trail went the other direction. Shocking.<br />Trail went through some woods, but a nice paved path paralleled it<br />not more than 20 feet away so we stayed on that. Important note:<br />smooth paths are more conducive to drinking lots of beer.<br /><br />We came out of the path onto a street and Bad Dog came up behind us<br />bitching about the runners who had apparently all shortcutted on<br />walkers trail and that he and someone else I don\'t remember were the<br />only ones to do the full trail. We looked at him like he was from<br />Mars and I reached into my coat pocket for my second beer. It was<br />around this point where we had a very spirited discussion on the<br />effects of a nuclear bomb falling on DC. Thank goodness for Nuclear<br />Jism who was able to tell us that we\'d all die (and not in the<br />initial blast either). My bad for starting that conversation…<br /><br />We cruised along for a while following trail. SMAC and Mr. Softie?<br />(somebody, anyway) were way ahead of us marking all the checks. At<br />some point I looked ahead and saw them coming back so I yelled<br />something like, &quot;You jackasses!&quot; It wasn\'t them. Just a couple out<br />for a walk. My bad again.<br /><br />We arrived at the beer check. Actually, we heard the beer check long<br />before we saw it (Motormouth was already there). It was buried off<br />the road down in some bushes so I, of course, stood at the top and<br />asked people to bring me a beer. Meanwhile I finished what was in my<br />cup. When the beer finally made it to me, it was some small, weird<br />shaped can that looked like it should be one of those alcoholic<br />energy drinks but was really just Budweiser in a weird can. I drank<br />it anyway. The runners mostly took off and the walkers stood around<br />drinking. I finished all the half drank cans left by the runners and<br />filled my cup. Again. Somewhere along the road I had finished my<br />other stashed beer from start so it was a good thing we brought the<br />beer check with us on the second half of trail.<br /><br />We somehow made it to the end. There was a lake. That\'s about all I<br />remember. Oh – and drinking beer. :)<br /><br />I was guest GM for the end circle (maybe I shouldn\'t have had so much<br />to drink?), but I think it went pretty well. I had fun anyway.<br />There were some violations, Fire in the Cornhole had some silly dice<br />that you were supposed to roll before you drank that were not as<br />funny as intended and we made it through. At the end, however, we<br />had a special event for the SH*T – a potential RE-naming.<br /><br />It seems one of our hashers had committed a renaming-worthy act at<br />the previous week\'s on-on-on. Free Willy had made friends with one<br />of the veterans at the bar. Very good friends. The kind of friend<br />where you make out and stuff. The kind of friend you go home with.<br />Did I mention to you it was the blind guy? As the story goes, while<br />she and he were making out he stopped and removed his fake eye. AND<br />REPLACED IT WITH A PIRATE EYE! Seriously. The nomination was set<br />forth to rename her One-Eyed Willie. The hash suggested some other<br />names (all lame) and ultimately we were in agreement that Free Willie<br />was no more – her new name, henceforth and forevermore throughout the<br />world of hashing (except Great Falls – F them), is One-Eyed Willie.<br />Arrrgh!<br /><br />And so my story ends. (Well, not really because we went to Kilroys<br />and drank some more, but I have to do some actual work today so<br />that\'s all you get.)<br /><br />Lube Me Up Scotty<br /><br />P.S. One-Eyed Willie claims she didn\'t sleep with the guy, just made<br />out with him. For the record</font></font></font></p>', ''),

Ennis and the <br />wonderful twosome of Hood Whorenament and O-69.<br /><br />Visitor: Gluteus Maximus<br /><br />The moonlight off of the Bowl America in December is spectacular to <br />see!  So was the return of two long time friends (and co-founders O-<br />69 and Hood), who came out despite the weather and family <br />responsibilities to lead this rag-tag group.  Thanks guys and it is <br />always great to see you!<br /><br />So we gathered at the BA parking lot and weathered ourselves next to <br />Metro Ho for sign in and for new SH*T merchandise;  the stocking caps <br />are excellent and at $10 they\'re the &quot;In&quot; item for winter.<br /><br />While pimping more gear I noticed the return of 3 Holes No Waiting, <br />Cockspur (who was not really a returner but it didn\'t stop me), Glory <br />Hole and the elegant 14K.  We also welcomed Gluteus Max from Taiwan, <br />who was home visiting family and decided to add some SH*T to her <br />life.  <br /><br />Certified promised a simple trail for the pre-holiday events and came <br />through with grace, as trail was fun, colorful and just a bit <br />chilly.  Hares were away on time, or as close as we normally get, <br />with all Hares going in the same direction.  We commenced with the <br />usual fare before taking off to the right and into the adjoining <br />neighborhood.  <br /><br />The walkers were graced by the usually fleet footed Rodeo F*ck, who <br />decided to take it easy for a change and be FRB for the walkers.  Our <br />trail was quick and enjoyable but we never went to Certified\'s house…<br />I really wanted to see her tree, and by tree I mean….!<br /><br />We could tell that the holiday season was upon us by the kindness <br />expressed on trail by our lovely Hares (lovely does not include Hood <br />or P.Ennis), as they made sure to write, &quot;Careful Ice&quot; on the <br />walkway.  I am still not sure what constitutes careful ice.  The path <br />led us into the neighbor hood of lights and onto VA Dominion Powers\' <br />favorite holiday street.<br /><br />As done in years past, every house on the street was lit in festive <br />holiday lights and expansive decorations.  I\'d try to describe it but <br />I can\'t so deal with it.  Like last year, we came to the house with <br />Santa in the garage and the kids pouring hot chocolate for the <br />passers by.  Our intuitive 3 Holes politely asked one of the little <br />ones serving chocolate what was the special occasion for the <br />refreshments.  The little ones are so cute when you ask them an <br />obvious question.  <br /><br />We wandered the street in awe, caught up to the runners and all <br />gathered in the parking lot for a frosty beer check beverage.  <br />Reloaded and refueled we made our way back down the street and short <br />cutted back to the BA lot only to find the Sterling police and fire <br />department in full regalia in front of the establishment.<br /><br />After waiting out the authorities we saluted out FRB – Glory, FBI – <br />Puke Me Up Buttercup and DFL – Udder Ho before saying goodbye to Hood <br />and O-69.  Certified promised that the hashit was near (she only <br />lives 4 blocks away) but that she had forgotten it.  <br /><br />I\'m beginning to think I\'ll see my first born before I see that <br />hashit again!<br /><br />Violations started with Pee Wee\'s Gay House and his brilliant <br />observation that the trail was A to A; he caught on to this when Hood <br />said that a bag vehicle was unnecessary since we\'d be coming back.  <br />Whack-A-Mole and Lube Me Up Scotty spent the walk time chatting about <br />work (uhhg), Porn to Fail, Dixie Queen and Glory were late (not girl <br />late), Pimpsicle was seen kicking a Coors light box – not sure what <br />that means, and Gluteus was attempting to get someone to follow in <br />the Taiwanese tradition of pissing on the Satan Clause decorations.<br /><br />Since Watergate was in a hurry we rushed through other violations, <br />but not before Dixie warmed my heart with a personal/custom song made <br />just for me (Bob Newbanks eat your heart out).  Circle was completed <br />and a paid OnOnOn was set up in the bowling alley for one and all.  <br />That\'s about the time that Bad Dog showed up and joined the crowd for <br />a glass of milk and some munchies.  <br /><br />A good trail, some good peeps and deep fried bowling alley grub.  Now <br /></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="2">&#61514;</font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">that\'s what I call Hashmus<br /><br />On out<br />Udder Ho</font></font></font> </font>', ''),

Our hares Pothole &amp; Andhowser Bush lead a hypothermic water laced trail thru the heart of McLean. The trail was broken up into 3 parts last night, one trail was for runners, one for walkers, and one for walkers straight to the bar, the latter having a significantly larger bar tab at the end og the night. Me &amp; my running partner Socket ran the first half of trail until we ran into a park where the trail seemed to loop a bit. Billygoat caught up with us at that point. Once we made it to the b-check we broke off onto the walkers trail and finished up there.

(477, 275, 'Trail #274: The Not a Porn to Fail Trail!<br /><br />Burke, VA (2007-09-25)<br /><br />Hares: Running Bare, Porn to Fail, Chasing the Beast, Naughty Pine<br /><br />This trail was set up to be a back to back trail as the<br />après location for this trail would be the start for the Wednesday<br />Over the Hump Hash. This was the return of the infamous John Taylor. <br />Hermes in all his splendor trying to clear his tarnished Pecker, uh I<br />mean name…Boys will be boys, and by the sight of him and Chef Boy R<br />Dumb naked riding around finish sans clothes, wasn\'t pretty. Ass<br />Odor narrowly missed a tea-bagging by the aforementioned ChefBoyRDumb,<br />but there was no way he could have squatted that low to the ground at<br />least without breaking something like the wind. We had a pretty large<br />turnout. STD came back from Dong land and handed out dongs to all<br />interested parties, and had a shirt for the FBI and Porn to Fail. <br />Roll-On came out after he\'s been up here for almost a year. That<br />boy needs to get his priorities straight. We had a visitor from the<br />Peurto Rico H3 that our Hugh Heifer revitalized. Bitch-Ass Beat Down<br />venerably took over the reins after Hugh left PR and kept it<br />going…Now he\'s been transplanted up here, so I\'m sure<br />we\'ll see more of his ass. OEWilly showed up with Das Boot after<br />she almost sliced off her big toe by kicking the shite out of a camp<br />stake. Lube me up Scotty was really showing her maternal side when she<br />learned a potential father was out hashing while his wife was in labor. <br />Either that or her whoremoans were in a ruckus…<br /><br />So off the hares went, being sent off by nub. We continued behind the<br />shopping center and came to a check back that put us on the outside of<br />the mall\'s wooden fence and paralleled where we were. We went<br />through some housing, and came out to an intersection. The pack went<br />straight, and I went checking left. I came down to a dumpster that was<br />in front of a powerline. That was it…I was hooked. They had to be<br />going down here, so I kept pressing on and tried to box the pack in on<br />my right. I went down the line a bit and then cut into the<br />neighborhood. I came across a street called Blarney Stone. That<br />couldn\'t be a coincidence, and since I was feeling lucky, I made the<br />better choice. Go down to the end of Blarney Stone. And lo and behold,<br />I found flour. I knew I must have been way ahead of the pack. I<br />pressed on true trail, making sure not to mark the intersections<br />(everybody knows shortcutters should never mark intersections)<wbr />. I came<br />out on the power line I started from, and there was no flour. I knew<br />the hares hadn\'t tied in yet, so I was running around trying to<br />figure out where they would have gone, when I saw beer bitch and Fire in<br />the Cornhole. I thought he might be shortcutting as well, and he asked<br />me what I was doing there. I told him flour ran out and I was trying to<br />figger out the end, and he told me I was at the finish. All was good<br />with the world. I got a 35 minute run in and cold beer all to myself.<br /><br />CornHole was pissed at me for shortcutting, not surprised, and sent me<br />off to fetch my car, warning me of the Po-Po up on the next level doing<br />paperwork. I got back to Start and had to lead in Free Pussy with<br />Clitty Litter (that\'s ironic, isn\'t it?) and Ass Odor. They<br />followed me to finish and we awaited the pack…Again we got accosted<br />by the police with a neighborhood anthraxing. AHHB went back from the<br />safety of the pack to go speak with the Police. He came back without<br />bracelets. We conducted circle, and was breaking up when another Po-Po<br />came by. We broke up and headed on to Glory Days.<br /><br />On Out,<br /><br />14kt<br />', ''),

I said to Spank, I don’t care what they say, I always have a blast at Rock-It and he agreed the On-On-On venue shall not change. In the end we found out that they did not kick us out, they just wanted to steal Udder’s phone! They stole my check card a few months back… They were nice enough to give it back after making a few 1-900 calls with it, THANKS ROCK-IT!<br /><br />So after work I stopped by the market to pick up some beer for the check, and they had oatmeal stout cheap, and I was immediately turned on. I picked up the loot and headed to Air Spankers house to ice everything and get it staged on trail. We headed out and realized there was not water, so he stops and picks some up… all the while I am wondering who the hell needs water anyway? So we stage the beer, I am hoping the walkers take it easy on the beer check, so I might have an oatmeal stout after trail. No such luck, walkers absolutely molested the beer check… I don’t even think they took a second look at the H2O.<br /><br />Back at AS1’s place we pack bags, grab a tasty brew, and head 100 feet down the street to start. When we arrived there was already a large crowd on the basketball court, and a bunch of locals walking their dogs, stopped in discussion about what the hell this big crowd of hooligans is up to.<br /><br />Beer vehicle ready, bag vehicle read, they call Myself, Air Spanker One and Mowgli into circle to introduce the hares (All our first time’s laying a SH*TTY trail!) and sent us on our way. AS1 took off into the neighborhood to lay out the first half of trail, while Mowgli and I headed to the temple to pick up trail at the split. Mowgli was so excited, but so nervous to lay trail. We had cum to find out he has only laid 2 previous OTH trails, and they sure were not recently. So like a 3 year old, he was asking questions about everything, and when we gave him the answer, he asked again.<br /><br />Mowgli starts laying flour at the split at the temple, we take them around the front of the temple and check them back, right into the beer check. After the walkers check we took them over the bridge into a bunch government buildings were there was still a good amount of foot traffic, and of course we got the suspicious looks for dropping this “mysterious substance.” Right after the bridge walkers and long reconnected. On-On through these fancy colorful lighted statues, and around the block we went into the round about. After the round about we did another big U-turn around the block, through an alley, and down through a parking garage. At the other side of the garage we split walkers and long again. Mowgli finished up walkers trail, and apparently everybody was able to make it in.<br /><br />Apparently at this point the pack was confused about a couple of things… I heard somebody say that they didn’t think trail could split again, so they just sat there and stared at the arrows. The other thing that they were confused about was the fact that the trail went down some stairs. Now we run through swamps and sewage and shaggy, and you are gonna question running down a few stairs????<br /><br />After the stairs on through a garage we skirted a wall down to a tunnel, well two tunnels, the pack decided the larger tunnel was the better option…. Either way you are getting wet! The water was half as deep as when we scouted, though… We thought it would have been about waist deep, which on Slit Lightening would be above her head. On up and down the road into a graveyard that definitely creeped me out, not to mention I felt I was disrespecting the people in there. But Spank said “I laid trail through here before, and I am not doing it again, YOU ARE!” Once we got outta there, trail went down a hill next to the power plant, and back across the crick up a shiggiful hill and into FINISH!<br /><br />Don’t recall too many of the violations, but I do know Mowgli was violated for haring with the HashIt that he has from OTH, so I can guarantee he will get it back at OTH. Had a great time out there.

We saw the return of our own<br />Sheriff LongJohnTaylor or Hermes for short. We had some visitors from<br />the Git\'mo bay hash Pufter the magic dragon and Poopy Party. One of<br />our favorites came out, SideShowBoobs and her Balkan friend Ball<br />Breaker. I\'m making these names up as I can\'t remember what<br />they were. Cornhole brought out two new friends too. A new beer wagon,<br />and a burly-bearded beer-guarding behemoth. Again I forgot his name<br />too. He was a good sport with a monster grip. And let\'s not forget<br />FayLay. Maybe she likes burly bearded behemoths, who knows? Watergate<br />came out for the warm weather, and unfortunately had to leave early. We<br />had our OTH track contingent ass well. Herpes (sorry, Hercules) likes<br />her some Mowgli. She ended up the evening with his pants and Chuck<br />Norris\' socks and shoes. That is some quick work. One-Eyed<br />FrankenFoot showed up too.<br /><br />With AHHB back at the helm of haring duty with his boy wonder, Motor<br />Mouth, what could possibly go wrong? Throw in two nawlin\'ers and we<br />got the recipe for some LA HotSauce trail curdling gumbo…<br /><br />So we sent the hares off promptly at 7, as I headed off to get dressed<br />and share some beer with my UdderBrudder. He was wearing these loud ass<br />Thrasher shorts, a perfect accompaniment to Hermes\' Bright Puke<br />Green shirt. What a pair! After introductions and a `ather Abraham<br />which consisted of me putting on my shoes and socks, we were off. The<br />pack headed over Algonkian and passed an swarth that I thought would be<br />a check back and eventually ended up being finish. Trail continued<br />north of Algonkian and eventually banged left along the back side of<br />some houses. We came up to a paved path that had the long/walker split.<br />Walkers went left and runners went straight. We then hit an<br />intersection that would go to the right, but I kept on going straight,<br />thinking they would eventually have to come back on this path. I<br />continued on by myself, and picked up some awesome trail treasure…a<br />broken lacrosse stick with webbing intact. I would later hold beers in<br />it. I came to an opening upon which I knew had to be where trail went,<br />but I continued straight, still without flour. Trail actually went down<br />that path, but I would find that out later…<br /><br />Then what do I hear in the foreground but the dinning of<br />MotorMouth\'s Mouth. And low and behold, here come AHHB and MM<br />coming right at me. They probably were wondering who the clown with the<br />lacrosse stick was and I asked them where the beer check was. AHHB told<br />me to follow trail backwards, which is what I did. I came to a huge<br />fence with a gate that I could certainly not fit through. A man\'s<br />got to know his limitations. So instead, I ran down the fenceline to an<br />egregious breach that a water buffalo could navigate. So I went into<br />the Golf Course and headed north without flour. I guessed that I was<br />probably not on trail again, but I saw lights to my right and eventually<br />headed back into the woods where I found flour and pack. They told me<br />the beer check was about 100 yards back. So I passed people with my<br />stick (they were all envious) and made it to the beer check re-united<br />with my udder brudder. We had a beer and took off. I took an extra one<br />just in case. Now Udder tried to go with the pack, and I said I knew<br />better, and we took the high ground. People were asking us what we were<br />looking for and we promply answered Beer. So the pack stayed in the<br />notsoeasilytraversa<wbr />ble tree line, while Udder and I stayed high and got<br />ahead of them while they were negotiating the gate. They caught up to<br />us and we cut right down behind some other houses where I held an<br />impromptu beer check where P.screwed Hercules and Lube shared the cold<br />gold. On across a little creek, and we were greeted by dogs and people<br />on their back decks. We went around the houses and back down a familiar<br />path where we had a check back that brought us back on the same path as<br />before. Socket and Udder and I led the pack on until we got to another<br />checkback. This is where Socket and Udder fell prey to my ignorance. I<br />thought for sure they would loop back on the same path and then head<br />back up to Algonkian. But no. they stuck with me, and we ended up<br />doing another half mile out and half mind back to where we would have<br />been had we stayed with the pack. I don\'t feel so bad. It was a<br />beautiful night, we were chatting, and they were training for the Celtic<br />5 miler in a couple of weeks. When we got back to Algonkian, we cut<br />left and eventually found an intersection and we headed back to start. <br />Up until trail cut left and down into a gully. Socket and I stayed<br />high, while Udder pressed on true trail. We thought the finish would be<br />behind the shopping plaza, but it was across the street. Socket went to<br />get her headbands and I went to get some beers.<br /><br />Kane showed up in time to help with Violations in a pith helmet from<br />Dora or Carmen san diego. It got tested with some shrubbery that tested<br />kane\'s patience. FrankenFoot threw out some bocce balls for good<br />measure, and I forgot to call the hares in for their trail.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the trail was well laid with plenty of flour in the<br />woods, with a nice blue hue to boot. Great Job Hares. We wished<br />everyone a safe happy thanksgiving, and proceeded to the Fox Chase<br />Tavern so Spike could get his fix of Cheese fries.<br /><br />On-Out,<br /><br />14K<br />', ''),

People started<br />assembling behind Kilroy\'s. I ganked two ESB\'s off the beer<br />check, thinking nobody would notice, and proceeded to hand them out<br />anyway. I was left with no beer until the chuck wagon arrived. Thank<br />God for Corn! You\'re doing a bang up job.

Namely Connie (who had hashed before, but was<br />going to attempt to do her first 50 miler, the JFfreakingK) and her boy<br />toy Ryan. We had some OTH contingent, both the HashMaster SheFingeredMe<br />and RA Air Spanker-1. Shaving the bush as usual, although I don\'t<br />know if she\'ll claim OTH as her mother hash anymore. Two YumYumBoys<br />Spike and Mowgli. I thought for sure one of those ass clowns would nail<br />me. I say me because Ass Odor had the locked in easy no way to catch<br />him part.

That\'s a free<br />tip…<br /><br />Holy said we were doing an A to A, but that was a mistake, so he<br />graciously offered to lend us his wheels for bags. We would have to<br />make two trips back as there were only the two of us. We introduced<br />ourselves, and then we had to split like bad dog\'s pants when he<br />bends over. That first ¼ mile of the parking lot sucked, and we<br />scurried down the hill and down braddock road until we were across from<br />Wakefield Park. Ogre laid a true trail and proceeded to lay the first<br />half of true trail all, immediately banging right onto the paths that<br />paralleled both Braddock and later 495. Check back into a check back<br />into a check back Ogre style. He should patent that move. It helped<br />that it was dark, but there are some cool paths back there. He led them<br />through the outskirts of the park, and finally brought them west bound<br />onto the big ass powerline where there was the Beer check (minus two<br />ESBs) and the Walker/Runner Split…<br /><br />That was essentially where Ogre was done as from now on he was laying<br />the Walkers trail while I picked up the Long portion. I found my way<br />through the dense fog going North/West and banged a hard right to head<br />to the tunnels going under 495. then I had to hightail it to the next<br />tunnel to bring the pack back to the powerline and continue heading<br />north/west into a checkback that brought them all the way across the<br />powerline, where I headed into the woods on the opposite side. I took<br />the time to admire the sea of lights heading my way through the fog from<br />atop a hill and continued on. I used my light sparingly thinking all of<br />the pack was behind and down the powerline from me. Butt to my chagrin,<br />I damn near ran right into Kane. He asked me if I was lost and I cursed<br />at him. He was hoping for Ogre, but got me instead. So I told him to<br />pipe down and just follow. We meandered down some switchbacks and when<br />I got down to the bottom of the path, I made the wiser choice of cutting<br />trail short and not crossing the creek into some serious shaggy. I did<br />this because a. it was cold, b. the pack was on my ass, and c. I<br />didn\'t think I would have enough flour to make it through the high<br />grass. So I did the next best thing where I looped trail back on<br />itself, and made an outgoing bt into a forward going true trail. I then<br />had to link up with where Ogre\'s trail hit and I was done. SFM was<br />on me like stink on poop, but I made it to the link up. From there I<br />went to go back to the beer check to clean up and have a beer if any<br />were left and I find Holy and Little C already cleaning up. Thanks,<br />guys. Although they blew through the beer, I took the bag from them and<br />Kane and I went back to get the bag vehicle while those two continued on<br />trail.<br /><br />I told kane where the finish was and he set off to get the vehicle while<br />I made it back to finish hoping that Ogre would have laid flour around<br />my hideous intestinal sculpture that I left the previous night. But<br />alas it was not to be. I no sooner got to the finish and people were<br />already complaining that they didn\'t have their bags so they could<br />change their clothes. You can never please all the people all the time.<br /><br />We tried to make circle quick, as people were cold, namely<br />GetOffMyEasySister and Shaving the Bush. They just needed some liquid<br />antifreeze. Post circle, we walked back to the start and headed into<br />Kilroys…<br /><br />On Out,<br /><br />14kt<br /><br />', ''),
(475, 280, 'Trail #279: The Trick or Beer Trail - Ballston, VA (2007-10-30)<br /><br />Hares: White Kane, Holy F@ck, LubeMeUpScotty, FarteenK<br /><br />Boo! Happy Halloween! We had a costume hash with 75 close<br />friends. Almost everybody got dressed up. Most notably, BigDogDumDum<br />came out with a scrooge/grinch like attitude by 1.) not dressing up and<br />2.) bitching about not having a running trail. Why not dress like a<br />geisha and the kabuki make-up that is his SunBlock One Million?<br /><br />I was having trouble getting to start, thinking that it would be<br />important to be there on time. Not! When I show up, 2 out of the 4<br />hares are already 3 sheets to the wind (Kane and Holy). They had<br />already laid trail as it was designed to be a TrickOrBeer Romp in the<br />neighborhood. CornHole was decked out on these huge stilts in a green<br />freakish get up that made him conveniently at BJ level for most<br />harriettes. He would stumble around feigning drunkenness just to run<br />his junk in unsuspecting females. His truck had a hoodie on it and two<br />kegs flowing away. Sam Adams was in one, and I don\'t care what was<br />in the other. I filled up a cup in time to take off for Hares Away.<br /><br />They were about to send the pack off, but I started running with a flour<br />bag to mark trail. So far there were only chalk marks on the road. I<br />had no idea where trail was going, I just followed it and laid flour to<br />help mark it. I had about a 5 minute head start, which was plenty when<br />the whole pack was walking. It was fun running by yourself dressed up<br />as a huge-ass Whoopee Cushion (not Whoopi Goldberg as Permanently<br />Screwed thought) with people walking their dog or when I had to cross<br />the street. I had a cup of beer and flour bag in one hand chugging<br />along, and flashlight in the other. I passed the first shot check and<br />continued on. I traipsed around the neighborhood, and came down to<br />where Mellow ForeSkin Cheese lives. He graciously let us convene in his<br />back yard. He would let people into his house to use the bathroom, and<br />we chatted as the remainder of the pack came in. We ran into PotHole<br />fresh from Jamaica in a Rasta Hat. I wonder where he got that…A<br />couple coolers of beer later, and the pack went off. I went to grab my<br />flour bag, and somebody took it. Apparently one of the other hares took<br />off with it to lay the remainder of the trail…Next stop after a<br />checkback that got most of the pack was PutsItOut/SucksMyDi<wbr />ck house. We<br />gathered up on his porch while he was chilling out in his living room<br />swigging some Magic Hat. There were more coolers of jell-o shots<br />dispensed. After the appropriate time, we headed out once again and<br />made our way back to the parking structure over SickySick. Back to<br />Start and on to the real debauchery of handing out Blow Jobs. Shaggins<br />was nice enough to offer up her cleavage and Summer\'s Eve was off to<br />the races making up his concoctions. Whipped cream and all. Some<br />harriers got into the fun for the girls as well. I think Craptain<br />America (Nub) took one for the team. We had some really clever outfits.<br />Standouts were the Fascinating Emma Peel from the Avengers. So soft yet<br />alluring hot black leather tight niceness. And a pistol to boot. FYI,<br />the name &quot;Emma Peel&quot; is a play on the phrase &quot;Man Appeal&quot; or &quot;M.<br />Appeal&quot;, which was one of the required elements of the character. Now<br />you know, and you are smarter for reading this crap. How real do you<br />feel, Mrs. Peel? I really liked BatGirl, and Hand2Hand\'s rendition<br />of a USO starlet equipped with kneepads to `service the troops\'<br />was both thoughtful and patriotic. Fuxedo was a friggin hottie, and we<br />did have a cutesy kabuki girl (not Bad Dog!). Hopefully we\'ll get<br />some pics up. Kane had his camera going, but he kept on saying that he<br />was doing this all from that cuff as he was really really drunk. By the<br />way, he had a bad ass Voodoo king outfit befitting Live and Let Die. <br />B\'money was keeping his pimp hand strong in his purple duds. <br />BeenPimpinSinceBeen<wbr />Pimpin! Let\'s not forget Chasing the Bush\'s<br />hot little legs in her #69 Soccer Ref outfit. How high do those legs go<br />up? Udder was in rare form as well sporting his playhare shirt.<br /><br />There were many outfits that I didn\'t describe and I apologize for<br />that, but gimme a break, it\'s been almost a week. Like I said, I<br />think some pics will show up somewhere.<br /><br />Then Circle started. Now that\'s a joke with some 75 drunk people<br />that don\'t want to listen, because they need some more liquid<br />antifreeze. We did have some virgins and some visitors. We tried to<br />get things going so that we could hit the Front Page. Kane handed out<br />prizes for the best dressed Male/Female. I believe Fuxedo won as did<br />ManAppeal. In the end, we kicked both kegs, three gallons of liquor,<br />and 200 jell-o shots. Where was Dixie Queen?<br /><br />On Out,<br /><br />14kt<br />', ''),

This<br />was the Big Hare Trail. A clever use of homonyms (I said homo) as they<br />wanted us to show up with big hair. OEWilly and Hand2Hand were locked<br />and loaded with their industrial size AquaNet can, and Udder Ho thought<br />the big hair was down there ifyouknowwhatimean…<wbr />AHHB showed up with a<br />dead poodle on his head. The newly<br />resignedhercommissi<wbr />ononceamarinealw<wbr />aysamarine Knee Deep came as<br />CherryPoppins, decked out in cammo skirt to boot. She was also<br />administering Cherries liberally and professionally at the beer check. <br />GayAssTrix came in some mullet contraption with<br />tightywhitey1980ste<wbr />nnisshorts. Buckwheat\'s cousin Farina (or was<br />that Stymie) came out and sported her Ben Wallace fro, for which she won<br />the prize…wait for it…a gift certificate for Hair Cuttery. The<br />50yr old Slip Knot just showed up with his regular hair. Split Puss<br />didn\'t have the big hair, but she was sporting some freak-nik flower<br />power top that had paisley flowers on the sleeves. Where was she two<br />weeks ago? So the lovely Socket enforced her sign in. She\'s good. <br />Beer was flowing and we had a couple of virgos with some visitors. <br />Skipper brought not one but two virgins. We had UptheEh and another<br />Canuck from Winnipeg. (**FACTOID ALERT***Did you know that Milne named<br />Winnie the Pooh after Winnipeg?), Mr. Exciting or is that Excrement<br />hailing from Fallujah, the most beautiful ManHole I\'ve ever seen<br />hailing from Portland Organ (previously SirWalters), The incredible Mr.<br />Bean (Indonesia?)<wbr />, and last but not least one of my favoriteist<br />traveling hasher Ghost Rider visiting from his new duty station<br />Marietta, Ga. Dixie Queen reared his ugly head. I haven\'t seen him<br />since his 4th of july camp out.<br /><br />So on to trail. Yes Virginia there is a santa claus, and I did not<br />shortcut. Trail went north out of the parking lot to an immediate split<br />for the walkers. This is where I had Riding the Tube and her buddy<br />PaiGow almost convinced that I was on the walkers trail. The runners<br />went across the street. Herpes had her little pooch snowball or<br />something, that almost didn\'t make it across the street when it went<br />back to play chicken with a huge fire engine. I wish I was hit by a<br />fire engine, cause GayAssTrix flipped me the moon. Arrrgh! The pack<br />got puzzled by both intersections and check backs. They kept us<br />together. For some intersections, the pack was spread to the four<br />winds, eventually after playing frogger over heavily traversed roads, we<br />made it into some woods. Then we popped into a neighborhood where we hit<br />a lot of hard ball. We eventually came to the beer check which happened<br />to be a hash house. Topher lived there. He joined us afterward. Cold<br />beer was dispensed, but more interestingly, Knee Deep was passing out<br />grain-laced maraschino cherries like they were tic-tacs. After this<br />things got hazy, because the pack had really split up. And I set off<br />essentially by myself. We were running up Beulah and we came across a<br />big ass parking deck that Mt Vernon finished up at this summer. I ran<br />into Gladiater who was hovering around the lot b/c he heard some<br />whistles (maybe Roll-on\'s Horn) and he came into the finish. He<br />says he stayed for the whole circle, but I never saw him. I ran into<br />HolyF and Cornhole and we chatted up with beer bitch and headed up to<br />the top of the structure to Finish. Not to say it was a long way up the<br />parking structure, but it took Holy and Udder 26 minutes to get to the<br />finish. We hung around finish waiting for the others to show up. <br />Cornhole had his collapsible trash can, and he brought out a recycle<br />container too. This man is on his game. Plastic cups and recycling<br />al-loo-mini-<wbr />um. He then broke out the previously opened bags of snacks<br />and then the new stuff. Halfway during circle, we ran out of beer. I<br />thought I heard AHHB say he had some beer in his trunk at the finish,<br />but he left without breaking it out. So Cornhole beat feet to get more<br />beer, and came back with a twelver of cold sam adams.<br /><br />The Apres was at the former Damon\'s, which is now called<br />Lucky\'s. this is a pretty big sports bar and has video games and a<br />cool air hockey table. There were black lights around the table, and<br />Bad Dog was taking all comers. He was sweating more after playing air<br />hockey than he does lumbering on trail. Skipper played a couple of<br />games with her virgin, and in the black light, you could see that Kane<br />wrote On-In on the back of her shorts. Thanks, Kane. Meanwhile,<br />Permanently Screwed had some prestidigital parlor tricks with a book of<br />matches.<br /><br />That\'s enough diatribe for one week.

Conveniently located in Shirlington right around the corner from Cap City we met in the UpperDecker parking lot where we could smell the aromas from restaurant row in Shirlington (best buns, I’m sure). The Secret marathon man was none other than OTH’s RA, Air Spanker-1 and his gimp ankle. We had a new on Sec in Socket and Hand2Hand was hawking hab-goodies. Speaking of goodies, CornHole brought out a veritable feast of yummies, namely fig newtons. Nice spread. As I tested the shocks in SheFingeredMe’s trunk, he broke out his camera from the AGM. There’s a certain point where we both don’t remember what we saw in the pictures, but that’s normal, right? Bad Dog followed me to the other parking structure assuming I knew where I was going. I parked across the street. Little by little, people kept meandering in. it’s getting dark out pretty quickly, so bring your flashlights fer sure. So Wookin pa nub introduced himself as the guest ra for this evening and sent off the Hares. Walkers went to the corner, and runners went down the stairs. This was to be an AtoA prime; which would come into play later…I realized that my batteries in my light were dead, and Slit Lightning scampered off to her finance’s car and lent me their ghetto light. I thanked her and proceeded to split off at the bottom of the stairs to see if I had my other light in my car. People thought I was shortcutting already. Not! </font></font></font></p><p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.19in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2">So as the pack went East, I grabbed my light, and when I came out I could find neither the pack or flour. So I hightailed it toward the theater, and went into the back, and crossed over the road and found myself in front! Whew! Frb for about 30 seconds. She Fingered Me was on my tail, and there was a runner/walker split that had us cross over this bridge and into an intersection. Everybody went left (correctly) as I followed SFM who ran across a bt. We blew through it and boxed it in to the left. He’s not as fat as me, so he was farther ahead, and while he stayed on the left side of 4mile run, I went across it to find flour. I yelled out for him, but he ignored me. Running Bare and Sr Douche did the same as I, and we found the true trail pointing us back to where the finish would ultimately be. They went looking down 4mile run, and I ran backwards hoping to find the beer check. Alas, I realized I was on Walkers coming in. I eventually made it back to where the trail joined back together and got accosted by a Latino who couldn’t find where his MRI facility was, and wouldn’t leave me alone until I called the service to find out where it was. This took like 5 or 7 minutes, and the recording said it was right next to bungalow billiards where we were to have our après. I tried to explain it to him and then ran off to find trail. Here comes Bad Dog saying I must have really gotten off trail. Ran on ahead and along the creek, where it started getting dark. I came across a whichy way and went across the creek thinking I would pick up trail on the other side. I paralleled the creek behind the ball field and came back across it right where trail joined up again, and lo and behold, I was FRB again when SFM came running up my butt again. We then came across the walkers, and SFM said something to FP about coming across her again. We would see her boobies later. We proceeded up to an intersection that came back on itself. I asked if anybody went to the right and nobody did, and when we got back to the intersection, that’s exactly where trail went. Across the creek, and back into a field where the Beer check was. We got to enjoy some cold gold and I think Spanker ganked Porn’s beer and either broke the glass, or made him drop it. It was humid, and you could see the steam coming off of people’s heads like piles of poop. We were joined on trail by Puke me up buttercup and Billy Goat MOFO with their little Hunter in a stroller. She would summarily dismiss him when they got to finish so she could drink beer while he went home with the kid! Nice. We hung around the beer check and finished off our drinks before the Hares took off to finish trail. I finally got going, and ran up to SlipKnot and congratulated him on being ½ Century old when I ran right into a low hanging bough. Ouch! Trail came out to 4mile run, and I went right. I proceeded on and saw SFM running toward me saying this was walker’s trail. I said f-it and kept on going, while he went back to join the runners. I came up on Porn who told me the same. I pleaded ignorance and continued. As I came to the same spot I was on an hour earlier, I saw FMB and Missing Link running the opposite way. I guess they did the same as I did and just wanted to get a little exercise in. I saw where runners came in, and contemplated for about 30 secs running backwards on runners until the pack caught up. I continued on walkers and Sr. doucheberg sans hashit mind you caught up to me. We ran by what was to be finish and crossed over the bridge where the first runner/walker split was. We thought this wasn’t a good sign, and thought he hares hadnot been through yet, and we headed back to the parking deck, and didn’t see any flour. So we turned around and came back just to find a freaking huge FINISH right where we passed it 4 minutes before. I blamed it on Doucheberg saying he didn’t see it before because it wasn’t written in Spanish. So we finished in a parking lot loading dock. The pack started filtering in, and Free Pu$$y started complaining that this wasn’t really atoa prime and that she needed to get the books and headbands. Hand2Hand had the books and some headbands, but that didn’t change the fact that FP was too lazy to go and get them. She quelled the angry mob by lifting her shirt and appeasing the gods. All is right with the universe. Circle was run, running bare and Ahhb got called in for a private party where we borrowed the long arm of the law from SFM, and those two got around giving themselves golden showers. Nub introduced the new mismanagement, and then the pack headed off to Bungalow Billiards. I couldn’t stay, so you’ll have to get the rub from somebody else.</font></font></font></p><p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.19in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Sylfaen, serif"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2">On Out,</font></font></font></p><p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.19in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Sylfaen, serif"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size="2">14kt</font></font></font></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><br /></p>', ''),

(570, 323, 'Hash Trash – Trail # 322 “The Trail is WHERE? Trail” 8/26/2008<br /><br />Hares: Fire in the Cornhole, Wookin’ Pa’ Nub, Just Abby, Beer Bitch<br /><br />It was a dark and stormy night as the wankers made their way to the start. Lightning was streaking across the sky, dogs were howling, babies were crying, dogs and cats were living together – mass hysteria! <br /><br />Oh wait, no it wasn’t. It was actually quite pleasant. There were birds chirping, flowers blooming, babies cooing, little fluffy clouds floating by, dolphins blowing bubbles in the air… <br /><br />Ok, ok… It was nice out and we’ll leave it at that.<br /><br />The hash got off to a rocky start when we pulled into Hooters parking lot only to find Bitch, Where My Money? telling us to go somewhere else for start. Sadness ensued as we drove AWAY from Hooters (yes, I’m a chic but I still enjoy a nice set of hooters!). Anyway, we reassembled across the street in a less conspicuous location.<br /><br />Free Pu$$y to Good Home opened circle. Or at least she tried. We ignored her first call and then slowly assembled in an abstract interpretation of a circle. She sent the hares away and the pack continued drinking. A disturbance occurred as Just Kelly and Just Debbie were brought in to the circle for wearing new shoes. WTF? Their sponsors are idiots (sorry Typical Woman and Just Matt – but I call ‘em like I see ‘em – train your virgins right next time!).<br /><br />Anyway, we promised to deal with them after trail and sent them back out of the circle. A short Father Abraham followed (I hate that song) and the pack was off. We ran through some woods and then through some parking lots and then randomly jumped from a path, across a street and picked up trail going in the opposite direction. Not quite sure how we found it, but apparently that was the way to go. At this point, we entered, “The Creek.” What does one find in “The Creek?” Lots of fun stuff and by “fun stuff” in mean vile creepy crawlies, flesh-eating brambles, prickles that will gouge out your entrails, stenches that will sear your nostril hairs and scary people called hashers.<br /><br />We wandered through “The Creek” until we couldn’t find trail anymore. At that point, we left the creek and picked up walkers trail. Turns out it was also long trail, but the hare (Nub) only laid walkers arrows on that section so we were confused and wandered aimlessly for some time before deciding to follow walkers. Oh well – at least it led us to the beer check. Hurray. At the beer check we found Fire in the Cornhole, Beer Bitch and Just Abby all scratched up and wet from waist down (well just Cornhole was scratched and wet from the waist down, Beer Bitch and Just Abby were just wet from their noses to their toeses but seemed no worse for wear). Oh, I should also mention that as we were running in we encountered the walkers heading out, backward on true trail. When asked, they stated that they had given up and were shortcutting back to start. That turned out to be a sucky decision on their part since the beer vehicle was still at the beer check and then the decision was made to cut the trail short and end there so the walkers went back to start and sat around waiting for beer that never arrived… I think some of them cried for their mamas before we finally redirected them back to the beer check/end.<br /><br />The second half of trail was brutal, here’s an account from our own GM, 14K:<br /><br />“First, I face-planted when I was leaving the creek. Then I hit that loop in the creek underneath 28. I was hitting true trail arrows backwards (I think) and when the trail popped back up it the thigh high grass, you couldn\'t find flour. Plus, I was out in front and by the time the pack caught up, I clued them in on an intersection they missed, and I tried to cross over the creek to get to the other side where trail must have been. The bank was about 15 feet up. As I scaled the dirt with soggy shoes, I finally got one hand locked on to the top and when I pulled my other hand up to grab some grass, I grabbed a head of a snake. I instinctively/reactionarily threw it over my head and this poor snake went swimming.<br /><br />By the time I got back on trail, I was able to follow it almost to 28, and then it ended. So I scrambled up to 28 and headed north and went to start.”<br /><br />14K didn’t have a good night. But he’s old, and old people complain a lot. ;-)<br /><br />Somehow we managed to get everyone in to the beer check/end (we think) – who knows, Bad Dog could still be out there…<br /><br />Free Pu$$y to Good Home and Lube Me Up Scotty opened circle with a somewhat less than auspicious start. We brought the virgin (Just Kelly) out and tried to make her drink without giving her a proper demonstration of a down-down. Our bad! That’s what happens when you get two chics winging it! Oh well… Circle continued on with Free Pu$$y recognizing the analversary (Permanently Screwed, 75 runs). Screwed was appropriately ‘wetted’ with his bandana by I Can’t Believe Its Not Herpes. Next came violations. We were too lazy to write anything down so Lube Me Up Scotty took violations from the crowd. Among those violated were the hares (duh), the hares (duh) and the hares (duh). Other violators were some people that I can’t remember. Sorry. See what happens when you don’t write things down? Sign up to be a scribe and write the trash yourself next week (hint, hint, hint). We serenaded Just Sara for her 61st birthday which is today (kidding – I know it’s only your 59th). I also remember that we brought Just Kelly into the circle to drink for her new shoes along with her sponsor, Typical Woman. I was too nice to make her drink from her sewage filled shoes so I tried to let her cheat her way through the shoe ritual, but the pack would not allow it. Luckily, another harriette had a clean pair of sneakers and with a quick swallow Just Kelly and Typical Woman were duly punished for their stupidity. Or not... <br /><br />Standard Deviant, current holder of the hashit, was called into circle to pass it on. He was pretty slow entering the circle so we thought he wanted to keep the putrid piece of crap, but alas he finally dragged his gray-haired old-man carcass into the circle and immediately nominated the lead hare (Fire in the Cornhole). Always a safe bet to nominate the lead hare for the trail when trying to get rid of the hashit. Newbies – remember that! Fire in the Cornhole immediately re-nominated Standard Deviant for being dumb enough to give the hashit up and then reclaim it during trail. Typical Woman was nominated for not properly training her virgin about new shoes and Just Sara was nominated for a reason that escapes me at the moment. Possibly for bragging about staying dry through most of trail, possibly for her birthday but probably just because she’s cute and the guys wanted to see her in circle. What can I say, they’re pigs – like that’s a shocker…<br /><br />To make a short story shorter, Typical Woman ended up with the hashit, the hares were properly recognized yet again for their SH*T-ty trail and then were made to lead the circle in Swing Low. It quickly became evident that the only part of Swing Low Fire in the Cornhole can do is the masturbation motion. But is anyone really surprised by that? <br /><br />ON-ON,<br />Lube Me Up Scotty<br /><br /><br />Post Script<br /><br />The Hashit’s ride home with Typical Woman:<br /><br />So, there I was, on the metro at 11 o\'clock with the prized - not really - hash-it. All was well, I was on my way back to the downtown living I\'m accustomed to. Yes, I had some strange looks from those joining my train along the way ... But as long as we made no eye contact, I kept moving closer to my shower with no questions ... <br /><br />Then, the bladder made a massive protest and Metro Center was the decision point. Do I get off the metro and use a \'public metro bathroom\' (which I\'d only heard rumors even existed), or attempt to make it three more stops to L\'Enfant Plaza? There was no choice, unless I was going to pass off the pee-puddle on the fella next to me. <br /><br />So, I disembarked the train and walked up to the metro man in the \'octagon booth\' ... I asked for the restroom (part of rumor was Metro Center was a \'public restroom stop\') and asked for a restroom. He opened the door slowly, all the while keeping an eye on the hash-it. Looking me up from the \'just got in a fight with a wild cheetah\' maulled legs, up to the top of the hash-it, he took it all in. <br /><br />Then asked, \'was there a rally this evening?\' ... I chuckled and responded \'this is what a running club gave as a token of appreciation. Like a dowry, only instead of goats and sheep, I got broken megaphones and rusty toilet brushes.\'<br /><br />Yep, that\'s how I sold the hash-it! He simply shook his head in bewilderment. Then he added, \'that\'s some token!\' To which I responded with \'Yes, yes it is!\' As I re-entered the station and gave my wave of thanks, without looking me in the eye he once again shook his head in what I assume was both acknowledgment of my thanks for his letting me use the restroom and that I was the \'craziest thing\' he\'d seen on his shift tonight. <br /><br />Once again, the hash comes through!<br />', '');

 Now on a normal trail I would have had to wait maybe 20 minutes before someone else showed up – either a hare or the pack.  Not this night.  I had plenty of  time to think of every horror movie I had ever seen that had anything to do with the dark or the woods or the dark woods or rain or the rainy dark woods…  you get the picture.  It was 8:20 before I saw anyone!  All I saw was someone emerge from the woods out of the corner of my eye.  I started to freak until I saw him reach into his bag and throw down a puff of flour…  Phew!  A Hasher!  (Not saying hashers aren’t scary – just scary in a different, nerdy kind of way.)  It was Fud Mucker emerging from laying part of the walkers trail.  He met up with me and started a beer but had less than two minutes to drink it before Socket came out of the woods.  I told him to get a move on and he was gone like a wet little puff of dust.  </span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="DE" style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">(Hmmm… </span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I guess technically you can’t have a wet puff of dust – that would just be mud.  So he was gone like mud?  That doesn’t work either.  Whatever – he left.)</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Socket had a beer and the rest of the walkers joined us.  Screwed was acting like a jacka$$ shining his light in everyone’s eyes so everyone tried to avoid him as much as possible.  No one seemed to have a bottle opened except Holy and since the hares didn’t leave one for us, we amused ourselves by playing pass the bottle opener while doing out best to finish all the beer before the runners got there.  We stood around shooting the SH*T and kind of waiting for the runners to make it in.  Cop S and Soft Serve joined us after finishing their sections of trail and added to the merriment.  Finally, we shooed the walkers out and me and the hares stood around waiting for the runners.  The runners never made it.  We finally gave up waiting for them at 9:00 because we assumed the walkers would have made it to the end and were probably wanting beer and their dry bags.  We took off, made a quick run by start to pick up the bag vehicle and beer and drove to the end (did I mention it was an A to B trail???) expecting to see the walkers.  All we found were Davy and Fud.  Uh-oh…  The walkers straggled in around 9:20.  They weren’t as pissed as you’d think, but not overly happy.  We began to talk about trying to find the runners …  Finally, Gladiator (the only runner to make it in under his own power) showed up and said that the pack had caught the hare (All the Way In) and were trying to find their way back.  Apparently All the Way In got lost and stopped until the pack found him so they could collectively try to figure out where they were.  Once the pack was together with the hare, they elected Just Mimi to knock on someone’s door to ask where they were.  Desperate measures, I tell ya’!  At some point in their travels, they also tried to climb a fence, which turned out to be some sort of military installation.  They were promptly yelled at.  (They were lucky they weren’t shot.)</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Finally someone decided to call the hares once they knew where they were and it turns out they were literally at least 5 miles away from start.  Nice.  The hares went to pick them up.  By the time we got them in, it was after 10:00.   The sign-in ladies tried to ask the runners for $20 each – we reasoned that they had run at least five hashes that night so they owed us for the four they didn’t pay for!  That didn’t go over so well although the rest of us though is was hilarious.</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We decided to do a quick circle – it was at that point where it really started to rain.  I read off all the violations at one time, we did a collective down-down and headed for the bar.  Luckily, we were in the bar’s parking lot so it wasn’t far.  Thank goodness for the bar.  They had cold beer, hot food and good karaoke. (Seriously – these people were actually good at karaoke.  It was kind of like being in the twilight zone.)  We ate, drank and were merry and all was (mostly) forgiven.</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">While this truly was a giant clusterf*ck of a trail, the terrain was pretty cool, the hares found some cool places for shot checks/beer checks and under normal circumstances it had the potential to have been a great trail.  Better luck next time, boys.  Perhaps you should get a woman involved on your next outing – she’ll be sure to tell you how it should be done right!</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Violations:  </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Yep.  Shoulda been there.</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Hashit:</span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> Still Udder.</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">See you in a few hours!</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Lube Me Up Scotty</span></font></p>', ''),

(588, 347, '<div>What day is today?  A hashing day, I get it.  Everyday is a hashing day.  You know what else today is?  Crazy.  It\'s also Naked Day, or something.  It\'s also the day I only got one potty break at work and had 1 minute and 45 seconds to eat my lunch.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.  So, based on my current state of mind, methinks I\'ll write up a quick and dirty hash trash.</div><div> </div><div>Trail #346, Herndon, VA - The trail who must not be named, or maybe it was the trail who changed it\'s name.  Or it\'s pants.  Either way.</div><div> </div><div>It was colder than a witch\'s titty outside, and a few handfuls of wankers (except me, I\'ve only got one handful) congregated outside the back door, awaiting entry.  At least, that seemed to be the theme of the evening.  But no, really, that\'s where we started.  Some back alley wind-tunnel, drinking beer, and b*tching about the cold.  Perhaps that was just me.</div><div> </div><div>Nub did the arctic, armless and leggless version of Father Abraham and sent the hares away- Poonskin Cap, Coppus Interruptus, Davy Crotch Itch, and my personal favorite \'Just\' name - Pavonka Wonka.  They were good and toasty from making the shot-check delights before trail, which probably explains what happens next.</div><div> </div><div>We \'head in\' through the woods, and we\'re running and running, and maybe walking, and stumbling along, looking for flour and very small rocks. (They float!)  First thing we come to is a creek.  It\'s cold.  I don\'t want to go through it.  So, Snatchasnorous and I watch all the other wankers plow through the water crossing, end up on the other side, only to get lost no matter which direction they went.  So, to entertain ourselves in the interim, Snatchasnorous and I practiced our trapeze skills.  After the s*x on trail, we used large sticks to walk over logs, essentially crossing the creek unscathed. (This being a relative term, as s*x in the woods can really do a number on your tailbone)  To and fro, high and low we went.  Couldn\'t tell you anything else, because we were all lost in the woods.  Why were we lost?  Probably because the hares kept kicking the flour on their own checks, trying to confuse us.  All was forgiven, however, once we arrived at the shot check.  HOT SPIKED CIDER.  Oh, it was my favorite.  I was so cold, I poured the cider all over my body and...hey...<wbr />you...wake up.  Quit fantasizing.  Right, so we kicked it at the shot check for a while enjoying the fruit of the distillery.  I don\'t really care what happened after that, because we all just wanted to get back to the cider at end circle.</div><div> </div><div>While we continued to enjoy the taste sensation that was the cider, we violated each other for a while:</div><div> </div><div>Porn to Fail - for his Michael Phelps impersonation.  Remember that creek I mentioned?  Yeah, he dove straight in, then headed back to start to change his soiled underoos and wait for the pack to come back.</div><div> </div><div>Penis PenPal - his pedophelia (encouraged by Deep Shit) creeped a few wankers out, especially when he kept saying he wanted to &quot;be inside her&quot;, or &quot;in cider&quot;.  Either way, it\'s just gross.</div><div> </div><div>Dixie Queen - for being the trampy show-off that he is, and flaunting his feminine figure all over the trampoline on trail.</div><div> </div><div>Just Andrew - he\'s a bit short on cash, and tried to pay for trail with food stamps.  He didn\'t even offer sexual favors.  Epic fail.</div><div> </div><div>Slowman - &quot; it\'s not about quality, it\'s about color&quot;  \'Nuff said.</div><div> </div><div>Fire in the Cornhole - ran the whole trail behind his dog, without a flashlight - and had to wait for the hares to catch up with him.  R*cist.</div><div> </div><div>Coppus Interruptus - Lost on his own trail and looking for a bailout.  That proposition was rejected b/c he is not in the porn industry.</div><div> </div><div>Hares - for giving kickbacks on their own trail.  everyone knows you\'re supposed to <em>receive</em> kickbacks.</div><div> </div><div>Wankers - we had a social for not being tramps like Dixie.</div><div> </div><div>Dixie - he couldn\'t find the back door.  Better luck next time.</div><div> </div><div>Poon - she needed 2 buddies to form a threesome, just to lay the walkers.  Since when do you have to recruit for threesomes?</div><div> </div><div>Slowman &amp; Jizzercise 5 guys - for having s*x on trail.  copycats.</div><div> </div><div>Jizz - for asking &quot;is everybody in?&quot; after the 5th person showed up.  Jizz, if you can\'t feel it when 5 guys are in....</div><div> </div><div>Snatchasnorous - for telling me &quot;i may have to insert it - I\'m cold&quot; followed by &quot;I think we\'re done here&quot;.  What happened to ladies first?</div><div> </div><div>Analversaries:</div><div> </div><div>Nub - 169</div><div>Just Andrew - 7</div><div>Be Cuz He Can - 49</div><div>Moroccan Mole - 56</div><div> </div><div>Okay, ladies and jellyspoons, now that I have checked this item off my list, I\'m allowed another potty break.  And guess what?  I think I have to poop.</div><div> </div><div>On-On to the Full Moon Hash tonight!</div><div> </div><div>(Your stunt scribe and Lube impersonator) Cradle to the Dreidel</div><div> </div><div>And now back to your regularly scheduled program.</div>', ''),
(587, 155, '<p>Trail # 155 – Lactose Free Milk &amp; Cookies<br /><br />Attempting to prove that AARP inductees still have it, Lactose <br />Tolerant gathered the troops for a quickie in Chantilly. The <br />assistants for this exercise were Everyone\'s On My Ass, White Kane <br />and the soon to be named Just William; funny thing that William is on <br />his 13th SH*T run and is still just a Just…SLACK A$$!<br /><br />Starting on the reflectively hot pavement behind the AMC bowling <br />alley did a number on my hair, but I persevered long enough to get <br />the masses signed in and directed to the beer. We had another lively <br />turn out with newbie\'s Our Own Vanna and Naval Jelly continuing their <br />de-virginizing efforts. I guess that these two wankers didn\'t leave <br />any virgins in the Big Easy, not that there are many there (per <br />capita). <br /><br />So we welcomed the fresh unwashed faces of Just Jennifer and Just <br />Josh (Vanna and Jelly), Just Dan (himself), and Just Ken (I Don\'t <br />Ride B*tch) to our holy union. And on the un-fresh and slightly <br />washed side we welcomed Pimpsicle, Tore Ass, Frick to Prick and the <br />far out-of-towner Sheik Xhoni (pronounced sh&#257; k <br />j&#466;&#324;&#275; or Shake Johnny <br />for you illiterate f*cks). Each visitor, virgin and newcomer had a <br />chance to dazzle us with abbreviated versions of who they were and <br />why they came but they\'re stories bored us so we Fathered up and took <br />off on trail.<br /><br />Our Hares started us on a trip of wonderment behind the adjacent <br />strip mall, where Dixie Queen threatened to push me (and anyone else <br />in arm length) down the slope. From there they treated us to a trip <br />across 29 and into the Giant parking lot before sending the runner <br />pack back off a check 8. Cockspur the Friendly Host brashly declared <br />to Cum of a Cum of a Sailor that we (walkers) should have stayed on <br />the other side of 29 since he was positive the trail went that way. <br />No one listened and after trying, and failing, to keep up with Rodeo <br />F*cks counting/running pace we found ourselves back across 29 to <br />where we started.<br /><br />Cockspur 1 – Cum of a Cum 0<br /><br />First thing that Cum of a Cum and Free P*ssy to Good Home noticed <br />when we crossed the road…a brand new MVP store (a little known <br />porn/adult store for those who don\'t know, keep it to yourself).<br /><br />Cockspur 1 – Cum of a Cum 1<br /><br />The pack forged ahead and across a small field that lead to a <br />neighboring road behind the sound wall. The runners had long since <br />gone bye-bye at this point so we passed the time waving to <br />unsuspecting passer bys and almost succeeded in getting a mother and <br />daughter to leave their vehicle and join in; the power of BEER <br />compels you, the POWER of Beer compels you&#61514;<br /><br />By the time we got to the sound wall the runners had returned from <br />their darkness trek through the tunnel with the fence in the middle. <br />Some folks failed to heed the warnings of the Hares and forgot <br />flashlights; thankfully Dos Cums A Lot brought his and led the way to <br />victory! Dos has requested MVP gift certificates in lieu of, &quot;thank <br />yous.&quot;<br /><br />Continuing through the neighborhood and side streets we found <br />ourselves getting thirsty and wishing for trail to go through the <br />pool (it didn\'t). We continued on in varied walking packs discussing <br />worldly topics (can\'t mention them here…too worldly and important) <br />until we found the BEER, and we rejoiced.<br /><br />Give or take a few minutes we continued (in heat) looking for the 2nd <br />beer check, that the Hares had promised; we only found water, which <br />Cum of a Cum saved me from. <br /><br />Cockspur 1 – Cum of Cum 2<br /><br />We finally made our way to a main road where we followed the <br />long/walker split through yet more neighborhood (damn!) and finally <br />into a new development (not yet a neighborhood) and on to the <br />pristine property of a friend of EOMA\'s, who graciously let us fowl <br />her back yard. <br /><br />The entire pack missed the 2nd beer check (it was under the evil non-<br />beer like water) so the Hares added it to the kitty while 14K and <br />Rodeo played &quot;touch&quot; football. Somehow Tore Ass made it in as FRB <br />and somewhere between Puke Me Up Buttercup and Split P*ssinality <br />there was a FBI. DFL was reserved for Closet Slut and Summer\'s Eve, <br />who showed up late, had no flashlights and couldn\'t find the <br />enormous &quot;L&quot;, &quot;W&quot; split.<br /><br />Violations were many and memorable for all but me, and since I\'m <br />writing this I\'ll cut to the stuff I do remember. Not even the <br />impending wrath of angry Norse Gods could sway us from our Hash given <br />duty of naming Just William, and so it began.<br /><br />Just William works at the Nissan Pavilion and does some free lance <br />video production on the side, you may have seen his works on such <br />recent title as, &quot;Lust in Translation&quot;, &quot;Fiddling Nemo&quot; <br />or &quot;Bebitched&quot;; but I digress. <br /><br />Surprisingly EOMA had very few stories to lend and the pack got off <br />to a slow start, but like SH*T rolling down hill things picked up <br />quickly. Just William shared two things that came up multiple times <br />in the process, 1) something about a goat being led out of his room <br />and 2) his response of &quot;Chicken&quot; to Buttercups, &quot;Wonder Twin powers <br />activate!&quot; statement. These things coupled with his lack of deal <br />closing during the T.I.T.S. weekend lead us to this:<br /><br />From now on, at the SH*T hash, and in the world of Hashing (except <br />GFH3) Just William will be known as: Little C*ck That Won\'t. <br />Celebrate among yourselves; I\'ve got to go catch Dos at MVP!<br /><br />On out<br />U.

Saver.  The merciful and oh-so-beloved hares of the evening took the balmy weather into account and shortened the original trail to spare us from a fate worse than life without cellphones.  Everybody was pitching in, it was sticky-sweet like the end of a romantic comedy.</p><p>Shortest opening cirlce ever, instructions were given, the hares were sent off without any pomp and circumstance, and the rest of the wankers stripped down to their epidermis and cuddled for body heat.  We noticed something may have gone awry when we saw the bag with two unopened bags of flour sitting by the beer vehicle.  I suppose these oh-so-experienced hares are so good they don\'t need flour?  Really, they didn\'t.  First, the ground was covered with snow...most of us can\'t tell our right from our left so discerning snow vs. flour was like quantum physics.  Second, I don\'t know what the r*nners did - other than r*n fast enough to keep their limbs from frostbite - but the walkers trail went around the side of the building and across the street to beer check.  We enjoyed pudding AND jell-o shots in the oddest little semen sample containers.  We took group photos with smiling faces, and played with Cornhole\'s dog who is extremely talented at catching flying ice chips.  When we\'d lingered long enough to worry about finishing trail in decent time, we followed the hare to where?  Back check to start, on-in.  Drunk, spent, and sweaty were we.  100 yards in 9 degrees is <em>brutal</em>.  Talk about a death march, the r*nners had it eeeeezzzeeeeee.</p><p>Violators:</p><p>Violations - really we don\'t need a reason, but we had many anyway.</p><p>No Name Nyet &amp; AndHowsHer Bush - impersonating spies like us with their roadkill babushka hats.</p><p>Mount Me Tender - overachieving by running more than a block from her house to start.</p><p>Poonskin &amp; just Pavonka - matching &quot;these boots are made for walking/your momma wears combat boots&quot; boots.</p><p>Just Jerry - our second black hasher, shows up in perfectly coordinated &quot;sisterhood of the traveling&quot; pants and sweatshirt.  Also, took forever to pop his hash cherry because he thought we were all losers.  After trail, he said &quot;that was fun&quot;, and turned us all into Jerry\'s Kids.</p><p>Nub - when trying to take pics of said smiling faces, found himself challenged by counting and pressing a button at the same time.  And later, for letting us know he\'s going blind due to extensive self-exploration activities.</p><p>Fire in the Cornhole - for wanting ring Udder\'s bell (my be-e-e-e-ell, ring my bell, my bell, ding-a-ling-<wbr />a-ling) and hunting on trail, chasing Nyet and AndHowsHer\'s hats.</p><p>Just Megan - she responds to any name, give her a try.</p><p>Poonskin Cap - caught hiding behind a truck taking self-portaits with a cheesy-poof in her mouth.  so caught up in the moment, she didn\'t notice Dixie\'s wanker in her face.</p><p>Dixie Queen - for trying to get in on the orange love.</p><p>Davy Crotch Itch - for having to seduce Poon with orange food to please her.</p><p>Just Andrew - congratulated for his participation in the Special Olympics Ice Skating Competition.  Attempted triple axel, a bit short on the rotation and just couldn\'t stick the landing... a huge deduction in points.  That\'s really gonna cost him.</p><p>Just Pavonka - reading the license plate on the beer truck [DRKORLT] says &quot;does that say Dork Alert?&quot;  truer words were never spoken.</p><p>Just KC - one of our beloved virgins learns his first painful bedroom lesson by getting Just Megan\'s name wrong.  And later, running off into the woods to have s*x on trail, by himself.</p><p>Mowgli - excited about popping cherries, and obviously the closest he\'ll ever come to that, given that he was referring to the jell-o shots.</p><p>Just Megan &amp; Mount Me Tender - for &quot;loving the hot, sticky, sweet chocolate&quot;</p><p>Poon - on her knees with Just Pavonka, s*x on trail.</p><p>Udder Ho - for running out of Herpes creme.</p><p>Davy Crotch Itch - for his Canadian Avenue Q hat</p><p>just Stephanie - late defector from Kickball, where I was team captain, and she wasn\'t smart enough to avoid groups where I have a management role.</p><p>Davy Crotch Itch - visits the sperm bank so often they apparently give him a &quot;can&quot; for his deposits, rather than shot-sized containers.</p><p>And now I will test how many of you read this far by announcing that I have three testicles.</p><p>On-On to bigger and better s*x on trail,</p><p>Cradle to the Dreidel (your scribe impersonator)</p><p><strong>Things that make you go \'hmmm\':  </strong>(Courtesy of Udder Ho) Can you create too many visuals in a blind joke?</p><p>Discuss.</p>', ''),
(591, 370, '<div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">She Fingered Air Spankers Flaming Udder Ho trail from last night.....<br /><br /><br />Colonoscopy.<br />Just gives you chills doesn\'t it?<br />Even the women get the heebeejeebees thinking about it. A rectal probe is not the way to start any day, a cup of coffee maybe but surely not a bottom\'s up exam. Well, it\'s no way to finish out a day either my grossed out little friends. And that\'s exactly what the S.H.*.T H3 trail last night did - they lived up to the shortened version of their namesake and ended the day with a colonoscopy in the form of a tunnel going under I -66. And this was no regular tunnel it was bend over tunnel even for those under 5 foot tall. Even a midget would have had to bend over in that colon of a tunnel.<br />And for added pleasure the water was fungus laden, odiferous, and slimy, and sludgery. Yes, I said sludgery.<br />Sludgery is all the stuff still stuck in there that never makes it out. Just like the stuff in the bottom of that tunnel. Sludgery is the reason the gastro doctor makes you drink 80 ounces of FLEET several days before an exam- they don\'t want to see any sludgery either because I assume, even to a poo doctor it\'s still gross up-close-and-<wbr />on-camera. That 80 ounces of FLEET says to not leave the immediate vacinity of a bathroom within 20 minutes of taking it. And they do mean 20 minutes. This stuff is not your mothers Correctol, no sirree. Once, I had been i n the field for over 8 days. This was before I started hashing which generally means you learn to do your business outside behind a blade of grass for cover. In the field, my intestines went on strike and when we got home there were still no picket line crossers so I was in a real bind (pun intended). I got a nice little bottle of FLEET and read the directions and warning and waited with no outcome whatsoever. So off I went back to the Giant to talk to the pharmacy guy when right there in aisle 9 my stomach let go with an explosive 10-day-backup-<wbr />this-is-more-<wbr />than-just-<wbr />a-wet-spill in aisle 9 roar that shook the rafters. And I ran. Ran like a starving wolf on an injured moose. I felt like an injured moose. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Yep, that stuff clears all the sludgery out, aisle 9 for sure. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Well, the hares didn’t bother cleaning the tunnel out so we had to wade through the 10-day-backup-<wbr />this-is-more-<wbr />than-just-<wbr />a-wet-spill in aisle 9 sludgery the entire way. And then half way through one of the genious’s known as wanker stopped in a grate area where you can stand up because his back was hurting, which cause a head-in-a$$ backup for the ten hashers behind him. We didn’t even know our heads were up the pe rson’s a$$ in front of us because it smelled so bad in there you couldn’t tell that you were up someone’s a$$. There were muffled cries of “WTF?” but you weren’t sure if that indeed is what was being said or not – it just sounded pretty much like it. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">So after 6 minutes of poo palace pleasure we were finally out and into the fresh air. But for the other 5 miles of trail your feet stunk to high heaven and every time the wind blew you were assaulted with the gut wrenching reminder of the colonoscopy you just had on trail. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In fact I am so overwhelmed with it all, that I can barely remember the rest of trail. I know we circled through a fairly nice neighborhood that had a car out front with all 4 tires not actually one the car, the car was resting on the tires as if on a tire bed. The tires were perpendicular to the rims. I don’t know if someone was just learning to put tires on a car and went it to get their daddy to show them what a great job they did only to have daddy flunk them with a big fat F for “that’s the most effed up thing I’ve ever seen” to which his child will surely burst into tears. Or if that car resting on its sideways t ires was daddy getting real ly pissed off at his kid and told him no driving and he means what he says so he took all the tires off, laid them on the ground and then let the jacks holding the tires off so his kid really cant drive. If this is the case, then that’s a dad who means B for Business. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">And we wandered around some more neighborhoods after crossing<span>  </span>Stringfellow<span>  </span>75 yards from the start, but almost 4 miles in round about colon sludgery trail miles to be on trail in some more neighborhoods to a mystically hidden beer check in someone’s back yard where there was no more water but 2 water bottle left so we filled them up with hose water and drank thirstily. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">At this point, Lube, myself, Milk Money and FeyLay all decided that 4.3 miles of pootastic trail was quite enough and we walked back to start, only to find flour on the path directly across the street from start so ended up on trail anyways. For us trail was 4.7 miles and for runners who stayed on runners trail after the beer check they spent 7 something miles of fun on trail. </span></div><div class="EC_MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Deep DooDoo and All the Way In raced like Kenyans af ter 26 miles for a gold medal and 300,000 cash prize money.

(1114, 578, '<div>The hash descended upon Green Briar Park in what\'s listed as Fairfax</div><div>but is a stones throw from Chantilly High School. The weather</div><div>threatened to get pretty bad but it never really amounted to much</div><div>during trail or circle... but it was a verified flash flood once we</div><div>got to the Blue Iguana!</div><div><br /></div><div>The Theme was Siete de Mayo, and my Mexican alter-ego (Eleccion de</div><div>Catadores) met runners at start in traditional sombrero and sarape</div><div>(from the traditional party store.) It was explained to the walkers</div><div>and runners that they would both be enjoying Mexican themed Beer and</div><div>Shot Checks and off the walkers hares Vaginger Monolouges and Little</div><div>Cock that Wont went. I had neglected to get any of my hare gear ready</div><div>so I had to grab my flour and set my timer but then was off... only to</div><div>be seen by the pack a few minutes later as I tried to sneak behind the</div><div>baseball field.. oh well as they say. The best laid plans... never</div><div>happen!</div><div><br /></div><div>The following is from accounts of trail recounted later by the pack (4</div><div>runners, 2 walkers). Becuz He Can stayed true to trail and followed my</div><div>On-Out marks left even though he knew it would veer off to the right</div><div>behind and around the baseball field.... Doctor Strangelove, Fudd</div><div>Mucker, and Bad Dog decided to shortcut over walkers trail.... lazy</div><div>wankers still never came close to catching me!</div><div>Off into Big Rocky Run Stream Valley Park, and out into the labyrinth</div><div>that is Fairfax County suburbs, twisting through the streets and their</div><div>neatly manicured lawns before splitting off from the walkers and</div><div>heading to a back check down hill through the thorn laced Virginia</div><div>Power Line Easement. The pack found a check on Fair Lakes Parkway and</div><div>at this point Fudd Mucker apparently decided to take the Mexican theme</div><div>to the max and headed south with no sign of flour until he saw Guapos.</div><div>The pack winded through another town home complex and around Northrop</div><div>Grummans private retention pond into the beer check, complete with a</div><div>mural of female genitalia by a local \'Urban-Artist&amp;#39;. The hash had</div><div>their choice of Tecate, Sol, Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Dos Equis,</div><div>Bud-Light Strawberry-Rita, and a special Mexican treat of Bud Light &amp;</div><div>Clamato Chelada Style! (more on that later) Bad Dog skipped the Beer</div><div>Check and headed off as FRB and blew threw a Walker\'s-Runners Split</div><div>choosing the walker\'s side. The Runner\'s headed down the power line</div><div>easement towards the Fairfax County Parkway (arguably they headed Up</div><div>and Down as this portion of the trail was pretty hilly!) A Back Check</div><div>at the end of the easement slowed the now 3 runners down a bit before</div><div>they headed north back into the neighborhoods and winding back toward</div><div>the Park. Meanwhile, Bad Dog was meandering around a neighborhood</div><div>following parts of Walker\'s Trail before the Walkers catch up and say</div><div>&quot;Hey, The Runner\'s went back down the Easement&quot;. So off he followed,</div><div>getting lost at the back check and then running back into the walkers</div><div>quite some time later. The Runners wove in and out of the park and</div><div>took a dip in Big Rocky Run (whose current was beefed up a little</div><div>following the previous 24 hours of rain!) en route to the Shot Check.</div><div>They were treated to some pre-mixed Margarita, and flasks of Silver</div><div>Tequila, and Gold Tequila! Thinking the walkers had already hit the</div><div>check, they took the shots with them and proceeded back out into</div><div>civilization and then... you guessed it, back into the park! The</div><div>aforementioned walkers were wandering aimlessly around in an 0.25km</div><div>squared area trying to figure out whatever Vaginger and Little Cock</div><div>laid for them. The runners came to a Runners Walkers split that was</div><div>meant to take them across the run again, but they were weak and said</div><div>no thanks, following Walkers trail back in... and missing the</div><div>shiggiest part of trail right near the end of Runner\'s True Trail. Oh</div><div>well, at least I had fun setting it! On their way in they ran into</div><div>Little Cock who had gone out to find the Walkers and passed off the</div><div>Shot Check to him (why they didn\'t keep at least one bottle I don\'t</div><div>know!) Finally Bad Dog led in the walkers and we all sat around</div><div>enjoying tales of the previous hours hi-jinks.</div><div><br /></div><div>Bad Dog, having missed the Beer Check and apparently never having</div><div>heard of the beverage, quickly fell in love with the Chelada Style</div><div>beer with Clam juice. Repeatedly expressing his joy at the discovery</div><div>and offering to do down-downs with it. I re-donned my Sombrero and</div><div>Sarape and Udder kicked off our circle (which he had lost control of</div><div>before it even started) When asked for a song for welcoming our Justs</div><div>into the circle, I improvised and came up with a song I shall now call</div><div>&quot;the circle song&quot;... it goes like this (with a planar clarification</div><div>added by Dr Strangelove) &quot;A Circle is the set of all points (on a</div><div>plane) equidistant from a central point.... yeeeeah Circle!&quot;.... Udder</div><div>said \'What was that?&quot; and I replied &quot;Euclidean definition!&quot;. Don\'t ask</div><div>what melody I sang, that was also impromptu! Fudd Mucker gave the</div><div>hares a compliment (I think)... It wasn\'t a bad trail... but it wasnt</div><div>good either. I told him he\'s more than welcome to set one himself to</div><div>show us better :)</div><div><br /></div><div>Circle details:</div><div><br /></div><div>Justs-</div><div>The Dynamic Duo - Just Audrey and Just Adrian.... Why again did we let</div><div>two justs go off by themselves on walker\'s trail? It\'s no wonder they</div><div>got lost! Just Audrey was a huge fan of the BudLight Strawberry-Rita,</div><div>grabbing the rest of the case and downing as much as Just Adrian would</div><div>let her.</div><div><br /></div><div>Violations-</div><div>Taster\'s Choice: For trying to impersonate Sasquatch as he tried</div><div>sneaking by in the sight of the pack so they wouldnt see where true</div><div>trail was from start, after having just spent the previous 3 minutes</div><div>laying a check in the opposite direction. I swear I thought they</div><div>couldnt see me on the other side of the baseball field against the</div><div>treeline in my red long sleeve shirt!</div><div>Becuz He Can: For being the only runner that actually followed the</div><div>true trail Taster\'s laid, while the rest of the pack shortcutted to</div><div>the scene of the BigFoot Sighting.</div><div>Vaginger Monolouges and Little Cock: For being too cheap to pay hash</div><div>Cash and haring two weeks in a row (I appreciate the help greatly</div><div>though!)</div><div>Bad Dog: For being DFL and FRB... last runner in but lead the walkers in!</div><div>I\'m sure there were some others, but I forgot.</div><div><br /></div><div>After Swing Low, we started cleaning up when a nice Policeman drove</div><div>by, shining his light on Bad Dog. (as the hare ditched his sombrero</div><div>and sarape as not to look suspicious)</div><div>&quot;Is that a beer you have there?&quot; the officer asked,</div><div>to which Bad Dog replied &quot;Nope just a Fresca!&quot;</div><div>and off the officer drove into the night to worry about other things.</div><div><br /></div><div>The pack followed Taster\'s Choice to the On-After, but Vaginger</div><div>Monolouges sped ahead and took the pole position (tee hee hee), but</div><div>managed to take a wrong turn and forced a full pack U-Turn in the</div><div>Jason\'s Deli Parking lot. We finally found our way to the Blue</div><div>Iguana, and proceeded to enjoy the beer and food available. I was only</div><div>able to stay for 20 mins but did enjoy my Blue Cheese Burger! On-on to</div><div>next week with Strokin\' My Wife Away!</div><div><br /></div><div>-Taster\'s Choice</div>', ''),

The purposes of â€œthe trashâ€ are many:</div><div><br></div><div>A) to chronicle for the ages our nefarious deeds</div><div><br></div><div>B) to remind those in attendance what we did (I can\'t think of any</div><div>reason you might forget!)</div><div><br></div><div>C) to make those who didn\'t join us see what they missed and encourage</div><div>them to join the next week</div><div><br></div><div>D) to give the trash author some brief validation of his</div><div>self-described wittiness as he giggles to himself while writing it.</div><div><br></div><div>I challenge you all to try your hand at it every now and then</div><div>(especially next weekâ€¦ cause I won\'t be there)</div><div><br></div><div>And so it began....</div><div>The intrepid hashers of SH!T gathered on this fine Tuesday evening in</div><div>the back parking lot of FFXFCU in anticipation of another Tuesday</div><div>night\'s misguided adventures through the lands west of the beltway.</div><div>The majority of the hash pulled their vehicles into the oversized</div><div>diagonal parking spaces, anticipating their inability to pull out</div><div>later without causing damage to adjacent cars. The Beermeister arrived</div><div>prior to trail to the vocal excitement of the pack who last week tried</div><div>to chase him down .25 miles into trail!</div><div><br></div><div>In keeping with the tradition of every trail having some theme or</div><div>dedication (no matter how far out of left field it is pulled) this</div><div>week\'s trail celebrated â€œNational Felt Hat Day.â€ The Hairs donned</div><div>something felt, I can\'t recall. Silver Lining sported a dashing</div><div>wizard-type cone hat, Vaginger went all Yule-tide with a Santa hat</div><div>(that had some shedding issues). I myself donned a large Lobster hat</div><div>(held on with my newly acquired 25 Run Bandana!) There were a few</div><div>others, but I can\'t recall (Note to self, start making notes before</div><div>trail starts, and not just halfway through circle!) With nor Virgins</div><div>we didn\'t need chalk-talk but that didn\'t stop us from drawing a</div><div>chalk-outline of Silver Lining laying on the ground.... which then</div><div>morphed into an abstract childlike turtle drawing... which was in no</div><div>way a depiction of Silver\'s usual trail speed!</div><div><br></div><div>We half-heartedly blessed the Hares and sent them on their way, before</div><div>starting up our usual half-hearted chorus of Father Abraham (Does</div><div>anyone know why we sing that? I understand the mock-stretchingâ€¦. But</div><div>was curious as to maybe if it\'s a ploy to seem as some religious group</div><div>in the event of interruption by â€œauthoritiesâ€) After an extended</div><div>period to give the Hare\'s a head start (With these two FRB\'s haring,</div><div>did they really need it?) we lumbered off south into a subdivision</div><div>before circling a retention pond and bounding into the north end of</div><div>Fair Villa Park. My plan this week was to take it easy due to some</div><div>knee issuesâ€¦ but I guess I\'m a glutton for punishment and found myself</div><div>in with the FRB\'s for most of trail. The hares provided us with a</div><div>trail of flour and multiple deep checks over and around the trails of</div><div>the park, leading us south as the sun set and left us plodding through</div><div>the dark (especially Doc Strangelove). After approx.. 1.75 miles we</div><div>found the BC hidden at a small grove of bamboo. Some hasher\'s may</div><div>remember this location from the amazing trail #556 set last December</div><div>by Stab My Cock and me. This was the place where (the slower section</div><div>of) the pack was approached by an angry homeowner with a Cross bow who</div><div>didn\'t appreciate our cries of â€˜On-On\' and â€˜Are You?\'. I believe it</div><div>was Erectional Officer that mouthed off to him and then Lush of the</div><div>Irish and Little Cock who were left then to handle FFX County\'s finest</div><div>who came to the sceneâ€¦ anyways! After the runner\'s downed a few cold</div><div>ones over horror stories of SWATT\'s online dating experiences, some</div><div>decided to follow a Runner\'s Walker\'s split up Andes Dr into a</div><div>neighborhood. Always one to choose shaggy over pavement, myself and</div><div>the rest bounded into wooded George Mason Univ property with a maze of</div><div>trails that snaked us over a mile into a GMU Parking lot and back up</div><div>into civilization again. We snaked through the darkened streets of</div><div>residential Fairfax, and tramped across the campus of Fairfax Villa</div><div>Elementary in a loop that cost us half a mile we\'ll never get back.</div><div>The remainder of trail led us in a winding manner northwest back</div><div>towards the start and connecting us back to the walker\'s trailâ€¦. For</div><div>about two miles! As the lights of the commercial enterprises on 29 lit</div><div>the horizon we knew we were back towards the beginning. The pack gave</div><div>â€˜Buenas Noches\' greetings to the Residentes of Los trailer park we</div><div>traversed and then curved back around the Credit Union to see the</div><div>smiling Hare\'s awaiting our return. I recorded approx. 5.25 miles,</div><div>however I also checked the wrong way significantly more times than</div><div>right. All The Way In, seemed to have the ability to smell the hares</div><div>and was without question the one to be following at checks this</div><div>evening!</div><div><br></div><div>Somehow the runners who gave up after the beer check, managed to get</div><div>lost in what should have been a cut-and-dry shortcut back to runner\'s</div><div>trail and got lost out in the mean streets of FFX. Seriously? In this</div><div>area you can\'t ever go too far without hitting a major street!</div><div>Members of the pack decided to venture out to scout them down, with</div><div>Just Christian leading the chivalrous charge just in time for the</div><div>walkers to round the corner and head in. Later AndHowsHer arrived in</div><div>with word that John\'s Place looked dark? (Waitâ€¦. Trail went nowhere</div><div>near John\'s Place!) He had managed to go almost 2 miles out of his way</div><div>to the 29/50 split and worked his way back to start! Eventually</div><div>everyone made it in and we kicked off Circle.</div><div><br></div><div>We had no Virgins this week but plenty of returnersâ€¦. Who I didn\'t</div><div>write down. But they drank.</div><div><br></div><div>FRB: Just Christian</div><div><br></div><div>FBI: SWATT</div><div><br></div><div>Violations:</div><div><br></div><div>All The Way In- Something about small holes and losing his True Trail</div><div>signsâ€¦. I should have started taking notes quickerâ€¦. It was the first</div><div>violation, if you want better detail then write your own trash!</div><div><br></div><div>Doc Strangelove â€“ For too little too late! He had a dysfunctional</div><div>headlamp until we finished trail. That\'s like getting an erection</div><div>after your partner has already left the bedroom!</div><div><br></div><div>Lush of the Irish â€“ Marking the start location as her territory.</div><div>After complaining about the lack of bathroom facilities at start and</div><div>finishâ€¦. She used the same tree both times as a substitute so any</div><div>other folks would know that is her spot.</div><div><br></div><div>Just Christian â€“ Rudeness to walker\'s he won\'t be going home with. He</div><div>ignored the rest of the Walkers as they came in, only asking how Otter</div><div>was.</div><div><br></div><div>SWATTT- Not having priorities straight! She was overhead describing</div><div>how she turned down a free offer of massage, oils, and worst of all a</div><div>case of beer from a potential suitor!</div><div><br></div><div>Strokin â€“ For taking the trail through a local rape-camp (a term I was</div><div>not aware of until circle) that had a bizarre Deliverance vibe mixed</div><div>with some good old fashioned patriotism in the form of a weathered US</div><div>Flagâ€¦. (when one hare drinks!) Some questioned if the two fast hares</div><div>had a quick rendezvous here during the setting of trailâ€¦</div><div><br></div><div>HASHIT!</div><div><br></div><div>Last week\'s recipient, AndHowsHerBush, did his best Dickens-esque</div><div>Jacob Marley impression on trail this week as he rattled the HASHIT</div><div>adorned with chains of empty beer cans.</div><div><br></div><div>Suggestions for this week\'s winner included:</div><div><br></div><div>Lush â€“ for leaving her keys in Little Cock\'s Ass (like a stopwatch in</div><div>Pulp Fiction)</div><div><br></div><div>____ - for purchasing last minute running clothes from Sears before</div><div>trail and leaving the tags on so he could return them after. (Note: do</div><div>not wear clothes from Sear\'s without washing them first!)</div><div><br></div><div>Iowa/Mark Twaint â€“ for getting married this coming weekend and then</div><div>leaving us to go on an extended honeymoon and not having the decency</div><div>to at least invite us along and lay a trail.</div><div><br></div><div>Vaginger/Monolouges â€“ Either for having sex on trail last week or NOT</div><div>having sex on trail this weekâ€¦ you pick. Pictures or it didn\'t happen!</div><div><br></div><div>And the winner wasâ€¦.. I don\'t knowâ€¦ I forgot to mark it down. Show up</div><div>next Tuesday and see who has it! (for some reason I think the</div><div>newlyweds were getting it)</div><div><br></div><div>We then proceeded to have a tandem naming!</div><div><br></div><div>Just Christian: is involved with The Otter Pink Meat (just a few years</div><div>his junior), is a Soldier who has been an Airborne Ranger but now</div><div>serves as a Data ANALyst. He enjoys cake in the same manner as a</div><div>fat-kid, is a racist (of the road variety, not socially), has a pair</div><div>of teenage daughters, has a fetish for mathematics, keeps dogs usually</div><div>reserved for Kardashian and Hilton heiresses (a Pughuahua?), once had</div><div>sex on a seawall in Jamaica, finds himself disturbingly attracted to</div><div>Janice the Muppet, and has an unhealthy obsession with Britney Bitch.</div><div><br></div><div>Suggestions included: Have your Cake and Eat it, Dutch Oven, Captain</div><div>CockCakes, Shit Me Baby One More Time, Shit Me Spears, and Flaccid</div><div>Rancid Boner (FRB)</div><div><br></div><div>Just Patrick: is involved with Vaginger, is a Utilities Marker, once</div><div>had sex with a girl who had not removed her used feminine hygiene</div><div>products from her person, recently had sex on the Clifton Railroad,</div><div>likes hash brownies, used to work as Best Buy (at the same time as</div><div>Vaginger, but pre-relationship.</div><div><br></div><div>Suggestions included: Pecker, The Rescuer Down Under, Forgot One in</div><div>the Oven, Miss Utility, Laying Track, Questionable Utility. Miss</div><div>Uturdity, Tampon Rescue.</div><div><br></div><div>After much deliberationâ€¦â€¦â€¦ for now and forever more in the world of</div><div>hashing (blah blah Blah) these two wankers will be known as</div><div>(Respectively)</div><div><br></div><div>Mathterbates and Track Marks!</div><div><br></div><div>Following the naming, we wished Iowa and Mark Twaint the best as they</div><div>have their nuptials this weekend and abandon us to tramp across the</div><div>globe, and of course the best of luck as they have sex for the first</div><div>time! (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) A little round of â€˜Swing Low\' and we</div><div>argued about where to go next. It was decided to try John\'s Place and</div><div>if it was closed (which it was) venture to Chili\'sâ€¦. which had 5</div><div>minutes left of kitchen time but had already given last â€“callâ€¦ kind of</div><div>a serious hash deal breaker. So we moved on to Primetime Grill!</div><div><br></div><div>We were welcomed by the Ciroc Girls who were doing promotional shots</div><div>for anyone who wanted. #winning. Those who joined us sampled some</div><div>beers and ordered some chow. Mental Note: I owe Mathterbates a few</div><div>beers after downing his once accidentally and another time with</div><div>intent!</div><div><br></div><div>Off I went into the night so I have no more to pass on regarding</div><div>further hash shenanigans at Primetime, but with some sort of</div><div>all-you-can drink deal they had going I can only assume it got crazy.</div><div>Hope to see you on trail again soon, and look forward to hearing what</div><div>adventures occur during and after next week\'s trail!</div><div><br></div><div>On-On,</div><div><br></div><div>Taster\'s Choice</div>', ''),

(Except</div><div>Vaginger, who tried to assemble in the parking lot of the nearby</div><div>Fairfax Commons and had to call and ask where we all were) There was</div><div>initial alarm as a FFX County Firefighters HazMat truck pulled up</div><div>alongside the packâ€¦. but any fear subsided as they unloaded and headed</div><div>into the shopping center to grab chow. Whew, crisis averted! All The</div><div>Way In set up the Haberdashery from the tailgate of his truck like he</div><div>was hawking wolf-pack/full-moon-shirts and snow-globes at a flea</div><div>market.

The remainder of</div><div>the trail description may or may not be what actually occurred for the</div><div>pack.... I can only vouch for the part of trail leading up to the beer</div><div>check and then the walker\'s split!</div><div><br></div><div>The pack left start and made their way into a nearby townhome</div><div>neighborhood skirting Highway 50 before arriving at a check that was</div><div>solved behind a fence and into the back parking structure of the</div><div>building housing the International Association of Fire Chiefs, I hope</div><div>they enjoyed the mysterious white splotches when they came to work the</div><div>next day! another check and trail was found on a paved path heading</div><div>west and down into Fair Ridge Park, past some nefarious people</div><div>conducting business on a tennis court in the dark. After a few checks</div><div>to slow the pack down they ran alongside some condos into a back check</div><div>that went straight into some deep dark and wet shiggy... if you made</div><div>it out of there without a scratch, then you have my admiration! I</div><div>threw my socks away when I got home because I didn\'t even want to</div><div>start picking out all the burs that gotten attached. Some of our more</div><div>balance-challenged hashers (Cough cough Silver Linings Cough Cough)</div><div>had difficulty staying vertical and tried doing flips into the muddy</div><div>drainage area before trail led back up onto a trail and down towards</div><div>and around a large retention pond. Always looking to get a few extra</div><div>seconds ahead of the pack the hares dropped another back Check along</div><div>the FFX County Parkway and the pack retraced their steps along the</div><div>pond before heading up the hill and heading down the parkway in the</div><div>other direction. A split showed the pack to head down into a drainage</div><div>tunnel for their first frosty on-trail treats. The Hares were nice</div><div>enough to leave a Boob Check just after... I never did find out if</div><div>that got solved properly! Walkers shot back out onto Monument drive</div><div>and headed back East towards the start, but the Runners continued off</div><div>into Rocky Run Park to enjoy a shot check, and down along a Power</div><div>Easement before finding another tunnel (Thanks ATWI for picking up</div><div>Just Finley on the rocky hill at the tunnel exit, the tunnel was a</div><div>spur of the moment addition by the Runners Hares!) Trail continued in</div><div>an around the neighborhoods of Ox Hill and pushed through the historic</div><div>Civil War battle monument and back in towards start.....</div><div><br></div><div>Now that\'s how it was supposed to go..... As Walker\'s Hare I passed</div><div>the runner pack as they were heading into beer check. I had been</div><div>slowed down by the other hares who found some trail treasure in the</div><div>form of a 2\' long and fairly wide PVC pipe that they wanted me to take</div><div>back to start for use as a Safety Third device... Sure thing I said as</div><div>I ran through the tunnel to pick it up where they left it. I should</div><div>have just said "Screw it!" that thing was bulky and a pain in the ass</div><div>to carry as I ran down the street attempting to lay walker\'s trail. I</div><div>must have tried 10 different methods of carrying that cursed thing</div><div>before I finally just held it across the yoke of my shoulders, many a</div><div>strange look was given by local pedestrians... and I was probably</div><div>audibly cursing too, that didn\'t help.</div><div><br></div><div>Sooo, I got back and waited.... and waited.... and waited.. and then</div><div>at about 8:30 PM I heard an On-On! Yeah, finally some people to talk</div><div>too and not just folks returning from their shopping and staring at me</div><div>in my Kilt and Tuxedo shirt... The Walker\'s headed in and I knew the</div><div>second half of Runner\'s must have had some issues! We continued to</div><div>wait and it wasn\'t until another 15 minutes that the Runners started</div><div>to trickle in! The Hares beat them in just barely and said the pack</div><div>had been on their heels for a bit. Either way, we set up shop smack</div><div>dab in the corner or the parking lot and dared anyone to keep us from</div><div>having our circle.... luckily no one tried!</div><div><br></div><div>Returners:</div><div>- Cheez-Jizz</div><div>- FuddMucker</div><div><br></div><div>No Analverseries because we don\'t have the data with us!</div><div><br></div><div>FRB: I\'ve Fallen and I Can\'t Get it Up (and he came in limping at that!)</div><div>FWB: Udder Ho</div><div>FBI: Burning Bubbles</div><div>FWBI: Vaginger Monolouges</div><div>DFL: Strokin\' my Wife Away</div><div><br></div><div>Violations:</div><div>- SWWAT wants a Wacky Wavy Arm-Flailing Inflatable Tube Man, when</div><div>there is plenty of the live variety standing around the circle!</div><div>- The Otter Pink Meat apparently doesn\'t know what paper money is and</div><div>paid for Hash Cash in Quarters (Note, Vaginger hates this... we should</div><div>all do it)</div><div>- Parent\'s Weekend for touching Just Joe\'s tip while â€œLayingâ€ trail.</div><div>- Silver Lining - For trying to do Gymnastics on trail and almost</div><div>drowning in a puddle.</div><div>- Just Finley â€“ for crotch punching males and females (It\'s just how</div><div>he says I love you !)</div><div>- Read Between The Slime â€“ for not having a headlamp while going</div><div>through dark wet tunnels!

Well</div><div>not this week. Strokin’ and I didn’t even give the pack a warning as</div><div>to how far we would be going as we bounded off into the Park nestled</div><div>between Lawyer Road and Glade Drive in Reston. The Pack huddled</div><div>together trying to keep warm as the time to chase after the Hares</div><div>approached. We had a drive-by by Swing and Whiff who wanted to say hi</div><div>and check out any new Hab we were offering, of course ATWI was happy</div><div>to oblige.</div><div><br></div><div>As the pack took off, they headed straight into the woods and soon</div><div>came across toilet paper strewn on tree branches…. It is a good thing</div><div>it was a smart pack tonight because the hares had forgotten to mention</div><div>any use of TP to mark trail. After a brief wooded excursion, trail</div><div>began following some of Reston’s beautiful paved walkways, however</div><div>with the extreme winds recently they were mostly covered with leaves.</div><div>A few checks helped slow the pack down and the trail went through a</div><div>delightful tunnel underneath Steeplechase Road. The Hares hoped to buy</div><div>ourselves a few more minutes of lead time with an artfully crafted</div><div>Back-Check up Steeplechase, but I’m pretty sure it only slowed down</div><div>ATWI by a few seconds. Shortly after the back check, a split for</div><div>runners and walkers took the runner’s east onto a wooded trail and the</div><div>walkers across a footbridge north. Walker’s opted for a few hundred</div><div>yards towards the beer-check (and didn’t find it) while the runner’s</div><div>had no clue they were embarking on a 3 mile loop! The runner’s</div><div>proceeded along trail in and out of the woods but generally heading</div><div>the same direction. I left a few checks (and one back check up a hill</div><div>that actually slowed them down this time!) along the path but it</div><div>generally kept going straight for about one and half a miles. When you</div><div>know the FRBs are faster than you (and you are bogged down with lbs of</div><div>flour) every check helps! I happened upon a great little fire pit</div><div>near Soapstone Dr and dropped off the first Shot Check to help warm up</div><div>the pack, Pink Electric Lemonade! Trail continued underneath Soapstone</div><div>through a tunnel that (unknown to the Hare who can’t smell) contained</div><div>some pretty hideous sludge and quite possibly sewage…. If I had known</div><div>this when I was running through it I would have enjoyed it more, but</div><div>at least I got a laugh at finish as the runner’s complained that I</div><div>didn’t have the decency to take them through a clean creek later to</div><div>wash off the stench! Trail finally turned in a different direction</div><div>crossing the creek by bridge and turning 180 at a playground. Off the</div><div>runner’s went for half a mile down an unpaved wooded path.

I couldn\'t find any information on anything</div><div>scheduled to happen that evening but it was a half-moon... so maybe it</div><div>was a hemiwerewolf kinda night? Either way it was cold and the streets</div><div>and sidewalks were extra icy... including the parking lot/skating rink</div><div>we started from. We enjoyed watching wankers slip-slide across the</div><div>black-ice as they tried to maneuver into parking spots. I thought for</div><div>a moment we would need to push AHHB\'s truck out by hand with the sound</div><div>of spinning occurring from his wheels. We all gathered in close and</div><div>tried to keep warm as Strokin\' explained some trail stuff... all we</div><div>cared about was that there would be a fire at the end! Off the Hares</div><div>went and a few minutes later we slid (literally) on out after them.</div><div>The trail took us along Brittenford Dr that we had come in on before</div><div>veering into Difficult Run Stream Valley Park. I almost bit it on the</div><div>ice as I headed down the first swale crossing the stream, I thought</div><div>the folks behind me had heard my cries to god as I flailed to maintain</div><div>vertical, but I could hear them behind me doing the same thing just a</div><div>minute later! We would spend the next 2 miles basically maneuvering</div><div>around the various trails of the park. The Hares did another great job</div><div>of providing good marking given the darkness, although that damn</div><div>orange-chalk is horrible in the dark! Luckily, with the fresh snow and</div><div>the half-moon you barely needed a headlamp to see the marking on the</div><div>trees. Stuff on the ground you had to be right on top-of due to the</div><div>coloring. &nbsp;We enjoyed a nice beer-check about 1.5 miles in and then</div><div>proceeded through the stream valley before popping out onto the WO&amp;D</div><div>Trail and crossing over Hunters Mill to find a thermos full of the</div><div>shot-check. I was the first one there and grabbed a quick snort before</div><div>heading on up the trail for almost .5 a mile before an intersection</div><div>took trail down into a small stream valley. Flour became few and far</div><div>between and I spent a good 10 minutes trying to make my way alone</div><div>through this section, using the old Land-Nav Circling method until I</div><div>found some more flour hidden behind a tree.

As the lights from the</div><div>road disappeared and the only signs of life I could see were flickers</div><div>from houses nestled in the woods, I began to get worried about yelling</div><div>On-On at full volume, lest the local Virginian homesteaders take me</div><div>for an intruder and show off their second amendment rights! Upon</div><div>reaching the bottom of the hill Newton\'s 69th Law of Hashing proved</div><div>itself once againâ€¦. â€˜What goes down, must come up\' and now I found</div><div>myself being drug uphill with gravity working against me this time!</div><div>The road hit a dead end and trail pulled us back into the woods then</div><div>back across Nichols Creek again before hopping back out onto another</div><div>Great Falls back road. A large BN adorned the side of the road near a</div><div>drivewayâ€¦ which was confusing because in usual SHIT Markingsâ€¦ that</div><div>means the END is Near. Either way, I was not about to argue semantics</div><div>when there were beers to drink. The Hares had smartly negotiated the</div><div>use of another Great Falls hasher\'s driveway to stage the Beer truck.</div><div>As I approached the house I was bit apprehensive because AHHB had</div><div>hidden the truck in the cover of a tree (Whether this was consciously</div><div>done, I do not know.) I again started to wonder if I was about to meet</div><div>a local\'s Smith &amp; Wesson, when I heard AHHB and moved in to grab a</div><div>brew. The rest of the runner\'s rolled in, followed by the walkers and</div><div>then latecomer Horse Jerker. Unfortunately for Horse Jerker, no</div><div>checks had been marked so he had had a long evening and was ready to</div><div>quench his thirst! Bad Dog confessed that he had jacked up Walker\'s</div><div>Trail because flooding and tree damage made it now impassible. After</div><div>he decided we had become too loud and unruly we were shooed off to</div><div>continue trail. The Walkers were then carted off in the back of the</div><div>truck to Auto-Hash back to start. The Runner\'s however still had two</div><div>miles to go and took off to explore some more of the fine residential</div><div>roads of Great Falls. A jump through some woods at a cul-de-sac</div><div>provided us two more chances to cross some creeks before spitting us</div><div>back onto Utterback Store Road. Here we met Bad Dog who was waiting</div><div>for the pack to tell us he might not have laid trail very clearly for</div><div>the next little bit and tried to shout out directions like an old</div><div>hillbilly rocking in a chair outside a country gas stationâ€¦.. â€œgo on</div><div>down yonder diagonally, take a right when ya hit the ol\' fence, follow</div><div>them there fence till ya take a left at the end and keep on clearâ€¦. Ya</div><div>can\'t miss it!â€ Here\'s an ideaâ€¦ next time just lay enough flour! We</div><div>aren\'t smart enough to keep all those fancy directions in our head as</div><div>we careen haphazardly through the briars and the brambles (of which</div><div>there were PLENTY on this next Â¼ Mile of trail!) we managed to survive</div><div>the directions and floundered through the shiggy before coming out</div><div>onto Nicholsridge road and it was a straight away back to start! Way</div><div>to take us through the toughest most dangerous shiggy right in the</div><div>last half mile Bad-Dog! I clocked about 4.25 miles of various woods,</div><div>roads, and trails through Great Falls. As blood trickled down my</div><div>knees, we stumbled in to start and then made our way down the hill to</div><div>a welcoming roaring fire and commenced our circle.</div><div><br></div><div>Returners:</div><div>Horse Jerker</div><div>Double O Positive</div><div><br></div><div>No Virgins, No Visitors</div><div><br></div><div>Analversaries:</div><div>Bad Dog! 269â€¦ only four more till your next Analversary (7x39)</div><div>The pack questioned Bad Dog about some metrics of his storied hashing</div><div>career and was able to pull from him that his record for â€˜most days</div><div>hashing in a row\' was 17! No one bothered to ask what percentage of</div><div>those were actually finished in a timely manner, however it was asked</div><div>how many gallons of milk were consumed! Also, his record for â€˜most</div><div>hashes in a week\' is 11â€¦ Way to take it to 11, Spinal Tap would be</div><div>proud (The Bandâ€¦ not the hasher!)</div><div><br></div><div>FRB: Falling and I Can\'t Get it up (Two weeks in a row!)</div><div>DFL: Strokin\' My Wife Away</div><div>FBI: Silver Lining (the Only BI!, also two weeks in a row)</div><div><br></div><div>Violations:</div><div>- Double O Positive â€“ For having the Most Tree Stands Per Capita.</div><div>- Strokin\' â€“ For ADHD at Circle. Zoned out staring in the fire and</div><div>blanked out when asked for a Down-Down song!</div><div>- Parents Weekend â€“ For Over Achieving. He brought a heavy ass cooler</div><div>full of ice and beer down the hill to circle before checking to see if</div><div>AndHowsHer had already done so (He had). It was suggested he not be</div><div>allowed to leave until he had drank every oneâ€¦ but seeing as he was my</div><div>ride I advised against it.</div><div>- AndHowsHerBush- For having a Senior moment. At the pre-trail circle,</div><div>AHHB didn\'t know whether Bad-Dog had ever haired for SHIT beforeâ€¦.</div><div>However an inspection of the HareLog shows that of the 4 Hare credits</div><div>Bad Dog hasâ€¦ AHHB has been co-hair 3 times!</div><div>- Taster\'s Choice â€“ For being a Troll and taking the time to stalk the</div><div>website to discern how many times Bad Dog had hared. (Trails in 2005,</div><div>2006, 2009, 2013â€¦That\'s 4 out of 269â€¦. Or 1.5% of all SHIT trails</div><div>ranâ€¦. Looks like we are due again for a Bad Dog trail in 2020 if you</div><div>follow the mathematical sequence)</div><div>- Strokin â€“ For ventriloquy on trail by making his Ass Talk at the</div><div>Beer Check (on a side noteâ€¦ do yourself a favor and Google</div><div>â€˜Butthoven\'s Fifth\')</div><div>- Bad Dog â€“ For trying to Kill the Pack! Laying a dangerous trail</div><div>along a road with no shoulder, no street lights, heading up a hill</div><div>with speeding cars coming from the other side!</div><div>- Pack â€“ AHHB violated the pack for not fucking anyone from Great Falls!</div><div>- Bad Dog â€“ For Narcissism. Laying 6 trails in a row in order to be</div><div>able to say he was FRB 6 times!</div><div>- Bad Dog â€“ For being a cheap skate! Laying 6 trails in a row to avoid</div><div>paying the hash-cash!</div><div>- All The Way In â€“ He was sick, and was barely standingâ€¦ which is</div><div>admirable to come on out even when under the weatherâ€¦ but stay by the</div><div>fire and drink! Don\'t go out on trail!</div><div>- Bad Dog â€“ For trying to pre-lay a SHIT Trail and using other hashes</div><div>markings! Here is the way we like to do it for future reference!</div><div>http://sohappyh.s459.sureserver.com/hare_guide.php</div><div>- All The Way In â€“ If you are sick and can barely get 4 words out of a</div><div>songâ€¦. Don\'t pick a song that no one else knows so you end up having</div><div>to sing the whole thing by yourself!</div><div>- Hares â€“ What a SHIT-ty Trail! Actually it was more like a</div><div>WhiteHouse-y trail, wrong marks and pre-laid! We\'ll see if OTH will</div><div>stand for that tomorrow!</div><div><br></div><div>No Hash-Shit this weekâ€¦ it\'s a shame, it would have been nice to pass</div><div>it on to Bad Dog to carry on his next several trails of the Sexfectaâ€¦.</div><div>I hope the rest of the hashes this week learn from our mistake and</div><div>MAKE SURE YOUR HASH SHIT is there!</div><div><br></div><div>Announcements!</div><div>Bad Dog invited the pack out to The Old Brogue in Great Falls Village,</div><div>where a few wankers continued on to join him and enjoy the 10%</div><div>discount he had haggled for.</div><div>We swung low and then proceeded to have an argument about how best to</div><div>put out the fireâ€¦. After which, we complained about how we had put out</div><div>the fire instead of sticking around and enjoying itâ€¦</div><div><br></div><div>Bad Dog WILL NOT be the hare next week, SHIT Mismanagement will host a</div><div>Herndon Pub Crawlâ€¦ more details to follow.

Hillbilly Hash". AndHowsHer gave us the</div><div>history lesson how this was “officially” the first Hillbilly Hash in</div><div>the DC Area (predating HbH3 by several years) and that he was going to</div><div>endeavor to channel these long lost hashers as he schizophrenically</div><div>set trail. We were urged to come dressed in Hillbilly or face the</div><div>threat of an old fashun’ lynchin’…. But I felt like I was the only one</div><div>who attempted. I was head-to-toe Camo print and due to the cold</div><div>weather was sporting a Blaze Orange hoodie… all ready for Beer Season!</div><div>(ba-dum-ching!)</div><div><br></div><div>Strangely enough he (who always complains when hares do not provide</div><div>detailed directions) neglected to clarify that START would take place</div><div>in a separate back lot behind the Safeway. Hasher’s could be seen</div><div>circling the main parking lot looking for any other kindred spirit</div><div>with a twinkle of beer-lust in their eye. Luckily, most of us</div><div>soldiered on and finally found the spot, enjoying some pre-trail</div><div>fellowship next to some dumpsters and trash compactor.</div><div><br></div><div>Pack:</div><div>Three Hands A’ Fistin – Visitor from Pike’s Peak H3 in Colorado</div><div>The Udder Ho</div><div>Spitz.Cum</div><div>Little Cock that Won’t</div><div>SWATT</div><div>All The Way In</div><div>Strokin’ My Wife Away</div><div>Doc Strangelove</div><div>Parent’s Weekend</div><div>Taster’s Choice</div><div>Vaginger Monolouges</div><div>Bad Dog</div><div>Just Allen</div><div>Just Joe</div><div><br></div><div>The Trail:</div><div>AHHB set a check from start and then headed off behind the Safeway…</div><div>One hare…. Hmmm guess we know which way this check will solve! I</div><div>decided I was going to walk this week, having been at the ER earlier</div><div>in the day and shot up with meds (I even sported my nifty admittance</div><div>wristband still). But with this trail it didn’t really matter whether</div><div>you were a walker or runner because AndHowsHers’ checks slowed them</div><div>down enough that they never really got that far ahead of us. We worked</div><div>our way towards the dockside at Lake Thoreau, and noticed that the</div><div>Lakeside Inn (The planned On-After) was apparently no longer in</div><div>business! So much for a true reenactment of the original trail! We</div><div>continued on through some Reston townhouses crossing South Lakes Drive</div><div>and waving to a delightful Police Officer as the entire pack jaywalked</div><div>across the road into the Woods and down a hill leading towards Lake</div><div>Audubon. It’s a half-mile into trail and the walkers still have visual</div><div>on the FRB’s! The Hare proceeded to take trail up from the lake and</div><div>into the backyards of the 4 story lakefront town-mansions before doing</div><div>a sharp left up a steep-ass grassy hill. It would have been nice for</div><div>him to leave a rope or something to help pull-ourselves up this grass</div><div>covered cliff! (it wasn’t that bad, but it sure felt like it at the</div><div>end) The hill slowed down the runner’s enough to put Bad Dog with the</div><div>walkers as we trudged up the face of “Mount Audubon”. Then Bad Dog</div><div>started trying to lay some of his “world famous” game on Vaginger. The</div><div>resulting exchanges between them were of great amusement to us as we</div><div>gasped for breath during the ascent. At the top of the summit we</div><div>continued to weave through the neighborhood and seemingly all downhill</div><div>another half-mile to a beer-check stashed in the woods below Sunrise</div><div>Valley Drive. After a little time at the check, the Runner’s headed</div><div>off in a direction opposite of the start location and the Walker’s</div><div>headed the right way. At this point it was basically just under a</div><div>half mile on trail for walker’s back to start (with another hill of</div><div>course!) Apparently the Runner’s continued on another 1.5-2 miles,</div><div>through some good shiggy and even crossed a big creek. Spitz gave up</div><div>when she saw the water and using her knowledge of the area headed</div><div>straight back to start and beat the walker’s back! Walkers clocked</div><div>about 1.9 miles in just under 40 mins. Overall a great quick trail</div><div>that used some quality checks and evil hills to keep the pack together</div><div>for the majority of trail!</div><div><br></div><div>FRB: Parent’s Weekend</div><div>FBI: Spitz</div><div>DFL: Bad Dog</div><div><br></div><div>Our Visitor from Pikes Peak, 3 Hands A Fistin’, hasn’t hashed long</div><div>enough apparently to know any songs, and isn’t funny. So he showed us</div><div>the Colorado Full Moon instead! Seriously dudes, any song will do,</div><div>just try.</div><div><br></div><div>No Analversaries since AHHB keeps forgetting the list…. So instead he</div><div>did a down-down to celebrate the 5th consecutive week of forgetting</div><div>the list.</div><div><br></div><div>Long Time No Seers: Spitz, Just Joe, Little Cock, SWATT, Doc Strangelove.</div><div><br></div><div>Violations:</div><div>Spitz – “Why You No Listen!” Two minutes after AHHB left (having just</div><div>explained his solo-haring philosophy for the night) Spitz asks “So who</div><div>is AndHowsHers co-hare tonight?) (** See HashShit nomination later)</div><div>Bad Dog – Forever Alone. As the pack moved into the beer check, Bad</div><div>Dog managed to lose trail 15 yards away from an assembled group of</div><div>wankers drinking!</div><div>AHHB – Attempted Murder. Forgot to leave an Oxygen Tank for the</div><div>walkers after the mountaineering expedition on trail.</div><div>Taster’s Choice – for trying to infect the hash with whatever was</div><div>killing him this morning at the ER.</div><div>Just Joe – Decided he would try to find out where the Beer Check was</div><div>by climbing up towards a road to look for a street sign… instead of</div><div>just asking any of the third of the pack that lives or has lived in</div><div>Reston!</div><div>Udder – TMI. Let everyone know that he ALWAYS leaves his “trunk” open</div><div>for the hash!</div><div>Spitz – Making our visitor feel unwelcome by chastising him for not</div><div>remembering 6” in Colorado. I’m sure he couldn’t forget 12” though!</div><div>(For clarification: 6” is apparently a hasher there)</div><div>SWATT – As usual, she just wants to be violated and begged for it…</div><div>your wish is our command.</div><div>Just Joe – Medfield School for the Gifted Diploma….. He spent a good</div><div>minute trying to twist off the pop-off cap for the Orange Food.</div><div>Just Allen – Couldn’t Cum on demand (with a hash song for Just Joe)</div><div>Taster’s Choice – for being a bad choir director…. Ok so here I will</div><div>rant for a second. I enjoy the violations in circle just as much as</div><div>the next, but this particular violation and attitude bothers me</div><div>every-time it comes up… and I’ve seen it happen here and abroad... Let</div><div>me explain… So, I tried to help Just Allen when he was looking all</div><div>“Deer in the headlights” when asked for Hash Song. I felt bad for him</div><div>and remembered what it was like to be a new hasher and have those</div><div>songs swimming around in your head and getting stage fright when</div><div>called upon out of the blue. So I snuck over and whispered “just say</div><div>‘Someone’s in my Sister’s Vagina’ and everybody else will chime in.”</div><div>So he did, and the pack started singing… but a few stalwarts started</div><div>jeering and shouted ‘He’s singing it wrong!!”…. All these songs we</div><div>sing in general are bastardizations of old folk songs, drinking songs,</div><div>and children’s melodies. And each song has many variations on it.</div><div>However someone wants to sing a song, as long as it’s some portion or</div><div>even if it’s not, let em sing it! At Interamerica’s Hash this Summer</div><div>in Panama I saw a guest RA belittle a hasher who only knew one song,</div><div>and that was the only song his very old kennel sings… because it used</div><div>different lyrics from the version the RA was familiar with. Half the</div><div>songs hasher’s warble I knew from my Fraternity Days in college (often</div><div>with varied and sometimes better lyrics, and usually with more melody)</div><div>Anyway What I’m saying is, let people sing what they gonna sing. It’s</div><div>ok to be a little different. If you berate those who try you just</div><div>discourage them from doing so. More love, less song elitism, more</div><div>songs, more beer. Rant Done.</div><div>Just Joe – For being Waaaay to Eager to drink out of his new shoes. He</div><div>was upset that no one called him on them… so he called himself out on</div><div>it instead…. We applied the fool-proof Gravity test and proved the</div><div>Shoe had no “Sole”. The pack graciously added various liquids to the</div><div>shoe and you know the rest. (See OnAfter description)</div><div>Bad Dog – Worst Pick up Lines of the night on trail. Including ‘I bet</div><div>I can convince you to take some clothes off’…. Has that one ever</div><div>worked for you?</div><div>Udder – Racist! He was wearing his Disney Wine and Dine Half Marathon</div><div>Swag in Circle!</div><div>Strokin My Wife Away – Was flinging his balls (of the cheesy variety)</div><div>at Vaginger.. What is this.. a fourth grade food fight!</div><div>ATWI – Song Fail! He froze up just like Just Allen… it’s ok ATWI is</div><div>new to hashing, he stole all those patches from somebody else.</div><div>AHHB – Spitz apparently thought that AndHowsHer used too much flour on</div><div>trail?? (Is that even possible?)</div><div>Spitz – Some Nerve! for Spitz to make that last violation after the</div><div>last hash she hared in May hardly used any flour!!</div><div><br></div><div>Which brings us to HashShit!</div><div>Last week’s Winner Strokin’ added a Trail Marking guide to help</div><div>alleviate the Carrier from having any issues following flour on trail.</div><div>(he was falsely accused by the walkers last week of laying a check-8</div><div>instead of a B-Check… it was proven by the runners to be baseless</div><div>slander!!)</div><div>3 Hands a Fistin’ – For getting ridiculously bloodied on trail… no one</div><div>else seemed to have a scratch!</div><div>Spitz – For vehement denial of her spiritual blondeness</div><div>Udder/Vaginger – For dragging the good(?) name of Strokin’ through the</div><div>mud last week.</div><div>Little Cock – for trying to nominate Strokin’ again for putting Duct</div><div>Tape on the Hash Shit… when it was actually Vaginger’s addition! Why</div><div>won’t we just let this man be, hasn’t he suffered enough character</div><div>assassination!</div><div>AHHB – now for a real violation… for not checking to see if the</div><div>On-After location was even open for business (it recently shut down</div><div>and was closed up…) It’s ok though, the pack decided at the beer check</div><div>to go to Glory Days instead.</div><div><br></div><div>And In honor of all the many hare’s he embodied this evening…</div><div>AndHowsHerBush was out big winner!</div><div><br></div><div>This week I actually went on to the On-After where our antics</div><div>continued into the evening. Before heading into the bar I was nice</div><div>enough to leave an artistic sculpture of mixed media on Parents</div><div>weekend’s dash board. I called it “Fruit of my Loins”… and it was</div><div>constructed a BananaGrams Bag and two oranges I found in his passenger</div><div>seat. I think you can figure it out ;) I hope the shop-goers enjoyed</div><div>the beauty of the art. Once in the bright lights of the restaurant it</div><div>looked like AHHB had taken a money shot to the face with the bits of</div><div>dried flour he still had stuck in the nooks and crannies of his mug!</div><div>As we got him talking about the laying of flour that night he admitted</div><div>he was just leaving beer check when the runners came up and had to</div><div>hide in the woods to stay unnoticed. Meanwhile, Just Joe could have</div><div>been denied access to the bar due to the drunkenness of his shoes,</div><div>squishily plodding through the room oozing out booze with every step!</div><div>Vaginger demanded she be given red-headed sluts, and someone suggested</div><div>just go look in the mirror in the bathroom. She however wanted more</div><div>than just one… acceptable hash-behavior! With Spitz’ giant skull cap</div><div>she looked like she was only a shopping cart away from being a bag</div><div>lady. A fun rag tag group we were, and after 45 mins or so I had to</div><div>leave. Anyone have any further stories of the On-After to share? Next</div><div>week it’s ALMOST TURKEY DAY!!!</div><div><br></div><div>On-on,</div><div>Taster’s Choice</div>', ''),

Lush of the Irish rounded out</div><div>our haring trio to make up for the ugliness of the rest of us. We</div><div>attempted a late St Patricks Theme, but you people were lame and left</div><div>us as the only ones wearing green!</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine our surprise when we came to scout the Sunday before and there</div><div>was blue flour and random hash marks layed about Wakefield Park?? It</div><div>seemed The White House Hash House Harriers were in the process of</div><div>using the same area for trail.... so we followed some bits of the</div><div>trail and skirted past their circle as not to interrupt their</div><div>debauchery and continued to scout out the remainder of trail.</div><div><br></div><div>Come Tuesday and it had started snowing earlier that afternoon and</div><div>kept going into the evening.... this was gonna be fun! The Wankers</div><div>started showing up and immediately headed into Kilroy&apos;s to avoid</div><div>standing in the snow... I stood in the lot and directed hashers to go</div><div>inside and we actually blessed the hares inside the pub before sending</div><div>us on our way! Off we went in the falling snow...I love hashing in</div><div>snow... I HATE haring in snow... so much extra work to make false</div><div>footprints and walk backwards, and climb places to avoid your damn</div><div>trail being followed.... also the terrain looks VERY different when</div><div>its blanketed in snow! some of trail was definitely NOT what I</div><div>scouted.</div><div><br></div><div>Since I only layed trail I don&apos;t know what silly things happened when</div><div>and if the pack ever left Kilroy&apos;s. I have a sneaking suspicion that</div><div>they just waited an hour and snuck around the side to trick us.</div><div><br></div><div>Trail went across Braddock and into the wilds of Wakefield park,</div><div>crossing a small creek and winding around the trails north to a check</div><div>on a road. It continued down around the back of the activity center</div><div>and then around the tennis courts and back into the woods. A Green</div><div>Jello-Shot Check was found underneath a power line tower and then</div><div>trail led up a hill towards 495..... BACk CHECK! I hope ATWI got that</div><div>one :)</div><div>Trail continued across the Power Easement and then dove into the woods</div><div>again heading straight for Accotink Creek and a beer Check hidden</div><div>under a log on the the sandy beach of the waterway.</div><div>Next Trail followed the creek before crossing at a fording point and</div><div>crossing back again a few hundred feet down on a treacherously snow</div><div>covered log.... Much to my dismay I was apparently the only one who</div><div>actually took that route... WEAK SAUCE HASHERS! It took me about 5</div><div>minutes of running to feel my toes again. The trail continued south</div><div>and worked towards Braddock Rd going underneath and winding back</div><div>through the neighborhood up an intensely long incline before spewing</div><div>back into the parking lot whence we started. Over all somewhere around</div><div>3.25 miles give or take a back check. The snow had stopped and we</div><div>congregated up in the usual spot.</div><div><br></div><div>We had a good size crowd given the weather and they were a lively</div><div>bunch.... and I can hardly remember who was there. About 12 of us I</div><div>think? Two Virgins brought by Lush of the Irish. Semen On The Pew, a</div><div>long-time DC Hasher, but apparently has NEVER ran with So Happy Its</div><div>Tuesday joined us. Coincidentally, he was the hare on my virgin trail</div><div>in 2007. Except that was in the summer, and not snowing! The Pack</div><div>drank and violated each other (wink, wink) I swear I should have just</div><div>put a chair in the middle of circle because the Hares were in just</div><div>about every violation group! The Hash Shit was given... I almost had</div><div>it for trying to sing the wrong song, but it went to whoever had it to</div><div>begin with... again, can&apos;t remember who. I tried to violate people</div><div>for not wearing green, but the greenies were in such minority that the</div><div>pack revolted and refused to acknowledge the violation!

Being as Far East in SH!T territory as we were, there</div><div>was a large contingent of more Urban DC Hashers!</div><div>At the direction of our RA Udder, the pack ambled off behind some</div><div>sports fields and into what can only be described as a thorny swamp.</div><div>There was to be no running for the next quarter mile as we slogged</div><div>through the mushy mud and attempted (mostly unsuccessfully) to avoid</div><div>the large amount of spiky plants and vines that populated the area.</div><div>The FRBs were the ones who had the joke played on them because trail</div><div>made a turn and headed back to the fields!

The wily hares took us up a steep incline only to come back</div><div>down to the path again a quarter mile later then slowed the pack down</div><div>with a Back check after a large group crossed over Prosperity Avenue ,</div><div>the pack back-tracked and many headed north along some paths... I was</div><div>skeptical and went south along the Creek to find some flower on a play</div><div>ground and Sounded the ON-ON! Some great hashing terrain along</div><div>Accotink Creek here, with a nice water crossing, lots of downed trees,</div><div>and all sorts of branches, divots, and bushes to act as obstacles in</div><div>our path to beer. We meandered south-east along the creek for a good</div><div>3/4 mile before an abrupt direction change back across the creek up a</div><div>steep embankment (Thanks ATWI for helping me up!) I managed to put my</div><div>knee straight in the blob of flour on the muddy creekside hill and</div><div>ended up with dough there from my wet legs.</div><div>We stumbled across the beer check as we broke back out onto a path,</div><div>the walkers has raided the supply and left a bunch of empties at the</div><div>top.

Some flour was found across the road in the park but</div><div>after a few blobs didn&apos;t continue. Some wankers headed down the road</div><div>only to realize they were following ash from some road flares and not</div><div>flour. Finally the pack found trail heading up the road and they</div><div>continued on for half a mile trying to avoid being hit by speeding</div><div>oncoming traffic as there were no sidewalks or shoulders for</div><div>protection (How did we not Safety Third Violate the Hares!!). we</div><div>finally checked west down into a neighborhood, enjoying the hilliness</div><div>that makes Northern Virginia so quaint (but hard on the legs!).

(1251, 627, '<div>April 8, 2014</div><div>So Happy It&apos;s Tuesday Hash House Harriers Run #626</div><div>"The You&apos;ll Be Sorry!" Hare-raiser&amp;#39;s Revenge Trail</div><div>Location: Shirley Gate Rd and Braddock Rd, Fairfax, VA</div><div>Hares: All The Way In, Anti-I</div><div><br></div><div>Pack:</div><div>SWWAAT</div><div>Taster&apos;s Choice</div><div>Deer Penthouse</div><div>D-Va</div><div>Horse Jerker</div><div>Nuclear Jism</div><div>Vaginger Monolouges</div><div>Just John</div><div>Lush of the Irish</div><div>Stab my Cock</div><div>Just Austin</div><div>Doc Strangelove</div><div>And Hows Her Bush</div><div>Cheap Ass Gigalo</div><div>Bad Dog</div><div>Just Ann</div><div>Little Cock that Won&apos;t</div><div><br></div><div>Our illustrious Hare-Raiser, All The Way In, vowed to make the pack</div><div>sorry because no one had volunteered to hare this week causing him to</div><div>have to pull a run out of his ass for us. He threatened that the trail</div><div>would be full of soul-sucking shiggy and that we would be merciless.</div><div>And of course, wankers be like &apos;Blah blah blah, ATWI, how many beer</div><div>checks will we have?&apos;. Hell hath no furry like a hare-raiser scorned!</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, I don&apos;t live all that far from start but left at the same</div><div>time I usually do.. so I rolled up to start just as ATWI was finishing</div><div>setting up the fluorescent On-On signs. SWWAAT was already there and I</div><div>shared my beers with them as we commented on the Hobo-camp a few</div><div>hundred yards up the road. If they can squat here then for damn sure</div><div>can we hash without any official interference. Ha, well we thought so</div><div>at least!</div><div><br></div><div>SWAAT proceeded to bemoan the fact that she had to work the night</div><div>shift so she would try and get her drinking in early! ATWI offered up</div><div>a Shot Check at start in a weak attempt to slow the pack down before</div><div>they even took off! Deer Penthouse and D-Va rolled up with Diva</div><div>hanging out the window to explain that she might already be drunk!</div><div>More wankers continued to assemble and AndHowsHerBush even showed up</div><div>BEFORE the pack left! We blessed the hares and shooed them off to go</div><div>lay the trail and continued our general Bull sh!tting for several more</div><div>minutes. Luckily Doc Strangelove came in a little late and announced</div><div>that he saw the hares laying a Bad Trail over Braddock Rd so we had</div><div>the first check halfway solved before even leaving start! Note to</div><div>Hares... don&apos;t make "On out" direction the way that people have to</div><div>come in to get to start!</div><div><br></div><div>A little rendition of Father Abraham warmed up our legs, but I just</div><div>kept going left for everything because I still had a beer in my right</div><div>hand.... gotta prioritize! and off we went shortcutting to Braddock to</div><div>the check Doc warned us about. And still some wankers crossed Braddock</div><div>road?! We never learn do we? The rush-hour drivers were confused by</div><div>the pack of wankers crossing each possible direction at the Shirley</div><div>Gate Road intersection before someone found trail in the woods across</div><div>Shirley gate and off we dove into the GMU Owned plot of land there.</div><div>Trail wound around trees and up and down some small hills and hollows</div><div>with the hare slowing us down by use of star burst checks.. We would</div><div>run up on the intersection mark and then there would be trail marks</div><div>going 3-4 directions straight out on the trees as far as the eye could</div><div>see. It was like a house or mirrors, trail everywhere you looked! We</div><div>finally figured out their MO was going west along the ridge of stream</div><div>valley and then we dipped down into a depression with a burned out</div><div>tipped over VW Bug for Beer Check. Horse Jerker had shortcutted and</div><div>thought he was being all suave by running past the check up on the</div><div>ridge yelling On-On, we just laughed as we let him keep going to solve</div><div>the next check while we enjoyed a beverage or two. Besides the usual</div><div>beer, the hares also left some of that Bud-a-rita stuff. How Classy!</div><div><br></div><div>The Walkers Split off from the runners at the beer check and stayed</div><div>in the woods (theoretically... we&apos;ll get to that later) while the</div><div>running pack hopped up a hill onto some streets and continued down the</div><div>residential area before circling a retention pond through some shiggy</div><div>and then getting stumped at a check in front of the Christian School.</div><div>The holier-than-thou soccer-moms in the parking lot seemed confused by</div><div>our bewildered stares and RU? calls as we tried to figure out where</div><div>the flour went next! We finally found it in the most likely place...</div><div>straight down into a bramble infested creek valley. I mean, that&apos;s</div><div>what I would do if I was haring! As we slowly picked our way through</div><div>along the waterway the dogs from houses to our right bellowed at us ,</div><div>most likely because I&apos;m pretty sure we were blatantly trespassing, but</div><div>they were trained well and stayed up on their porches overlooking us.</div><div>(The latter end of the pack would come across their owners when they</div><div>finally caught up, story in violations!) The Hares were nice enough to</div><div>take us out of the thicket and up a slope into the athletic fields of</div><div>the school. but this respite was short lived as we headed back into</div><div>the woods (and into private property again probably!) We were very</div><div>near the spot that Little Cock and Lush met the infamous Angry</div><div>Crossbow Wielding Resident back in Dec 2012. You&apos;ll have to ask them</div><div>for that story! We continued back by some other nice big expensive</div><div>houses overlooking park land and then saw something fluorescent ahead.</div><div>The terrain started to look familiar and we realized we were just NE</div><div>of the beer check and that was the Walkers (with Little Cock in a</div><div>bright yellow SH!T shirt) STILL at the beer check! We had managed to</div><div>slowly pick our way through over a mile of shiggified trail and they</div><div>hadn&apos;t budged (They had however been drinking so it was acceptable</div><div>hash behaviour!). The runners continued pushing forward bouncing along</div><div>the stream bank until pushing out of the valley and up onto a road as</div><div>trail headed back towards Shirley Gate Road. We crossed over the busy</div><div>road and found trail along the backside of some church... whatever it</div><div>was we had to slog through some pretty mushy, muddy, grass before</div><div>pushing back into the woods where we were welcomed by a second beer</div><div>check!</div><div><br></div><div>At this point in trail, the sun had finally set, head lamps were</div><div>clicking on, and we gathered around the cooler and discussed how fun</div><div>trail had been up to this point..... we jinxed ourselves. The next</div><div>mile of trail was pretty brutal... this is where ATWI got his revenge.</div><div>It started off okay with some fun log leaps and good terrain, but the</div><div>added darkness mixed with a seriously thicker level of greenbriars led</div><div>to some pretty intense yelps of pain (I even heard AHHB complaining</div><div>that there was too much Shiggy!) We broke out from the woods onto an</div><div>access road near the Jewish School and passed over the athletic field,</div><div>thinking we were in the clear but then we penetrated the woods again</div><div>into a briar patch that would have made Brer&apos; Rabbit Scared. There was</div><div>no running at this point, it was straight up picking your way through</div><div>hoping for a few seconds of pain free movement before the next thorn</div><div>got ya!</div><div><br></div><div>Soon the lights and sounds from the road appeared and we broke out</div><div>onto the street we started from! The End was in sight. We found a nice</div><div>open clearing near a radio tower and waited for the rest of the pack</div><div>to gather!</div><div><br></div><div>Another great trail by ATWI, and if you want to save your legs, arms,</div><div>and faces, from further wounds SIGN UP TO HARE.

And this year it also happens to fall</div><div>on a Blood Moon (which no one in the DMV could see due to overcast</div><div>weather) and the Judeo-Christian Holiday of Passover (Pesach) where</div><div>they celebrate the Angel of Death passing-over the houses of the</div><div>Hebrew Slaves kept in Egyptian Captivity and not killing the first</div><div>born of each household (The Egyptians, with their lack of lamb&apos;s blood</div><div>over their doors, were not as lucky.) Soooo I decided to go with an</div><div>Angel of Death and Taxes (in Wheel of Fortune Before &amp; After fashion)</div><div><br></div><div>Taster&apos;s Choice (myself) was haring so the weather was meant to be</div><div>sh!tty! (See two weeks ago... and then make it colder and wetter) A</div><div>steady rain fell on us at start as wankers waited in their cars to</div><div>avoid the just above freezing temps. By the time the hares were ready</div><div>to split, sleet had begun falling, and before trail was done it was</div><div>straight up snow coming down like the 7th Plague of Fire and Ice! The</div><div>hare&apos;s were a little worried that SH!T has gotten soft when (at the</div><div>time of our departure) the hare to pack ratio was 4:3. In sight of</div><div>that we decided to re-evaluate the trail plan, chop off about half of</div><div>it, and combine walkers and runners earlier than planned. Don&apos;t worry</div><div>plenty of shiggy and beer was still available! Luckily two other</div><div>wankers showed up a tad late.</div><div><br></div><div>Since I was the hare, I will only be able to regale you with a recount</div><div>of what trail was for us as we set it, and the stories I heard from</div><div>you wankers following! Luckily only two of you actually finished trail</div><div>as planned so I won&apos;t give too much detail so I can use it again!!</div><div><br></div><div>So... Trail... On out to soccer fields... into some brush and a check on</div><div>Stringfellow Rd. Trail continued to a check at Autumn Willow before</div><div>diving into some woods and giving the pack a respite from the sleet</div><div>falling. Over logs, up hills, down into a hollow and through some</div><div>serious thorns the trail wound before settling on a check next to</div><div>stream..... stream isn&apos;t quite the right word given the amount of rain</div><div>from the day before... it was up past my knees and with a slight current</div><div>as I trudged through to lay a very clear true-trail arrow on the other</div><div>bank. Only two members of the pack decided to push through and</div><div>continue to follow trail along a civil war era road bed. The others</div><div>blew through a bad trail mark and continued strolling until they ran</div><div>into Doc Strangelove who was setting the On-in trail.... Can you call it</div><div>snaring the hare when you weren&apos;t on trail? These wankers proceeded to</div><div>wander around for the next hour in the snow following parts of trail</div><div>backwards to a beer check that Doc had forgot to mark. We&apos;ll get to</div><div>them later, just imagine that they are cold and wet with no beer for</div><div>now. Back to The true-trailer&apos;s (Spew Me Father and Semen) who found</div><div>themselves at a check, it would be discerned later that Spew Me</div><div>managed to pick the wrong way at every check on trail. Just Austin,</div><div>who was giddy with excitement at his first opportunity to hare, used</div><div>setting each bad-trail as an opportunity to stretch out his legs and</div><div>get a good jog in... translation; the checks were not short if you went</div><div>the wrong way. Spew Me clocked over 4 miles for this maybe 2.5 mile</div><div>trail... lesson to be learned? Don&apos;t go the wrong way! We were expecting</div><div>about 4-5 wankers on trail but with only 2, the checks slowed them</div><div>down more than we hoped! Walkers and runners trail split here... but no</div><div>walkers were on trail at this point so it doesn&apos;t matter. The pack (of</div><div>two) leaped across Lee Highway and up into a wooded playground</div><div>clearing before maneuvering through a neighborhood towards a power</div><div>line easement. Another patch of woods held a beer check next to some</div><div>old civil war earthworks. The hares offered a fine assortment of</div><div>quality beers including a themed selection of Devil&apos;s Backbone</div><div>&apos;Azrael&apos; (Angel of Death). However the pack only drank one beer before</div><div>moving on.... The next morning I went to pick the check up and it was a</div><div>frozen block of ice and beer! Kept cold all day in my car! Trail</div><div>headed into and out of a stream valley and back briefly through some</div><div>neighborhoods before delving back down into another hollow with a</div><div>rising water level. Some fun log crossings and a slip-slidy hill side</div><div>provided the pack with some fun terrain before following Willow Spring</div><div>Run under a tunnel. Lucky for the pack, the tunnel offered some brief</div><div>relief from the snow that was now coming down hard! Also lucky for the</div><div>pack was the fact that the water level in the tunnel lessened the</div><div>muck-level of the mud at the bottom. The trail continued through the</div><div>woods along the creek side, through some brambles and smack into..... a</div><div>Back Check 10. The wankers told us later they just sat and stared at</div><div>for a minute, cursing us under their breaths. Back to the tunnel and</div><div>up onto the road they went before crossing Lee Highway again to begin</div><div>snaking through a subdivision and diving into Willow Springs Run Park.</div><div>You know those little stepping stones they put at creeks to walk</div><div>across safely? Yeah, those were under water! Trail continued to twist</div><div>along the path and was supposed to circle around a retention pond</div><div>towards the second beer check, that only the wily-wankers who didn&apos;t</div><div>do the trail (as laid) partook in after we showed them where it was</div><div>(and marked it). Oh well, at least they got some beer finally. The</div><div>two-pack however kept on going straight and bypassed it before finally</div><div>zig-zagging up a power line easement on in. The wintry mix now falling</div><div>fairly steadily we decided to forgo standing outside any longer and we</div><div>all sallied forth to Red Rock&apos;s Caf? for end!</div><div>It was poker night at Red Rocks but we decided to take over a few</div><div>tables on the other side of the bar since we looked like a bunch of</div><div>homeless people (except Horse Jerker, who lives across the street and</div><div>ran home quick to get a shower before joining us!) I got us some</div><div>Nachos and AndHowsHerBush ordered a few pitchers and we started doing</div><div>what hashers do best... drinking and gabbing! We needled Just Austin for</div><div>stories to save as tidbits when it comes to naming time, we shared</div><div>stories of the trail (or lack of in some of the wankers case), and we</div><div>toasted our camaraderie in stupidity by hanging outside and running</div><div>through creeks and woods on such a SH!TTY night! I had to leave after</div><div>I scarfed down some quick tacos, so someone else will have to tell you</div><div>which local Centreville-Cougars tried to take Bad Dog home.</div><div><br></div><div>Those of you that stayed at home all nice and snuggled up missed a</div><div>great trail! Can&apos;t wait to use it again when the trees and thorns are</div><div>all in full bloom again! On-On, Taster&apos;s Choice!</div><div><br></div><div>See you on April 22nd when Parent&apos;s Weekend and the other SH!T Jews do</div><div>a late Passover run (because they were all celebrating Passover last</div><div>week and missed trail!) He promises it won&apos;t be the Cluster-F*ck that</div><div>last years 8 mile debacle was. Silver Lining is involved so hopefully</div><div>that lends some credibility and she will keep them from getting</div><div>schwasted before laying trail!

For all 2 of you that actually read these, I forgot to mention</div><div>last week that I hared trail wearing ER wrist band, a token from an</div><div>early morning visit that day where I was diagnosed with</div><div>Conjunctivitis... I promised not to touch anyone and nobody showed up</div><div>this week with Pink-Eye so I&apos;m glad I avoided any violations for</div><div>trying to spread disease through the hash!</div><div><br></div><div>Herp and Parent&apos;s Weekend teamed up again (cue horror film shrieks) as</div><div>is their custom this time of year to force us to recognize their</div><div>religious leanings by reliving the 10 plagues of Pesach (Passover).</div><div>The hash-spin on this is that the plagues are presented to us in a</div><div>symbolic fashion as Shot Checks! You might recall last year&apos;s debacle</div><div>(I can&apos;t really even call it a trail) an 8+ mile death march in the</div><div>Wakefield area (This is Passover... not the exodus!) where most of the</div><div>hashers just gave up and headed back to start due to lack of flour and</div><div>questionable checks. You see the problem is that these two usually</div><div>get fershnickered over the course of a few hours before trail... this</div><div>isn&apos;t too bad unless it&apos;s when they are the ones responsible for</div><div>laying the trail! This year they did the same thing.... But only after</div><div>they prelaid at least half the trail. So it wasn&apos;t the jacked up</div><div>abortion of a trail we have come to love and expect from these</div><div>menches. How do I know it was pre-layed you ask? Because the flour was</div><div>wet after about the first  1/4  mile, meaning it had been there before the</div><div>quick rainstorm! Another clue was when they both very conspicuously</div><div>ran past the pack (waiting to head out on trail) down Braddock in a</div><div>direction that was not where trail was (so they could link up to the</div><div>end of their pre-laid section and continue laying trail. So anyway....</div><div><br></div><div>We gathered around in the parking lot of a church and met some new</div><div>faces, Loves the C*ock from Tel Aviv H3 in Israel who was in the area</div><div>for work and picked a fitting hash to attend, Ginger Southern</div><div>Comfort, a transplant from the Los Cruces H3 in New Mexico, and his</div><div>girlfriend Just Courtney, a virgin who he had talked into coming out</div><div>to run. It finally warmed up enough for IOWA and Mark Twaint to come</div><div>back and spend some time with us too! And Just Austin returned... note</div><div>people that he has hared and has been out regularly for enough</div><div>trails.. a naming could be coming soon!</div><div>The hares described that the shots would be marked with a flour Star</div><div>of David (described irreverently by the hares as two triangles</div><div>f*cking). The directions to find the shots were to "look left, look</div><div>right, look up, look down, l&apos;chaim!" (say it out loud... its makes more</div><div>sense)</div><div><br></div><div>When the time arrived most of the pack headed off in the direction the</div><div>true-trail arrow pointed.... But Amber Alert headed off in the direction</div><div>we saw the Hares go by earlier when they tried to sneak by and he was</div><div>followed by Ginger Southern Comfort, who ditched his girlfriend,</div><div>leaving her alone with the pack! We&apos;ll get to them later... because</div><div>they never found any trail and ended up back-tracking and doing trail</div><div>alone in the dark! Seriously, who Zens from start when you are at a</div><div>pack you have never ran with and don&apos;t know where you are??</div><div><br></div><div>I won&apos;t describe trail in my usual manner because I fully intend to</div><div>steal portions of it for a future trail!

Watch out for errant balls! (snicker</div><div>snicker) . Down into a stream valley, up out of a stream valley, back</div><div>into the stream valley! Shots up in the sky! No seriously... the hares</div><div>climbed up a deer hunter&apos;s tree stand and put one of the shots there!</div><div>Fork in the stream and a check but we found trail and continued on for</div><div>a half mile before climbing out of the shiggy and onto some pavement</div><div>for a short period. Walkers split off and caught back up with us a</div><div>mile and half later. Runner&apos;s headed up a long incline before diving</div><div>back into some woods and a series of checks that kept going straight.</div><div>Shortly after the second mile trail continued up a hill, but knowing</div><div>where we were I suspected a back-check as we passed a perpendicular</div><div>trail. AndHowsHer took the bait and I split off to find the true trail</div><div>shortly after... I think it was a back-check 9 or 13... the Hares had said</div><div>13 was a mystical number to the Jews so expect lots of those... but</div><div>there weren&apos;t that many actually! We followed some twisting trails for</div><div>about half a mile and then plunged creek-valley-swamp.... Literally,</div><div>Some SERIOUS Mud here folks. The sun was starting to set and darkness</div><div>was creeping in. The cooler weather following the storm created some</div><div>fog in some of the low-lying areas of the shiggy which sucked for me</div><div>because I was wearing glasses and they kept fogging up! It&apos;s hard to</div><div>bushwack through shiggy with no sight... I fell a few times, but luckily</div><div>no one saw. At this point I was the FRB and I went crotch deep in one</div><div>hidden spot, luckily as I pulled out of the mud and continued up a</div><div>hill out of the valley I kept quiet and heard Just Austin fall in too!</div><div>Aunti-I was just behind him and was able to avoid the same fate.</div><div>Apparently when AHHB fell in the same hole it was quite the dramatic</div><div>event, complete with flailing arms and school-girl shrieks! The next</div><div>half a mile gave us some more good shiggy and then all of a sudden we</div><div>burst out onto the road and could see start across the street. I was</div><div>kind enough to let Just Austin rush past me to the Finish to claim his</div><div>FRB Title! About 3.6 miles of some great shiggy, fun checks, and 10</div><div>delicious shots! So then we waited.... And walkers came in.... but we</div><div>still had several running pack members (the ones who had decided to</div><div>try and snare the hares but failed) out still. Just Courtney started</div><div>to get worried because she had the keys and Ginger Southern Comfort</div><div>wasn&apos;t answering his phone, but finally after some discussion as to</div><div>how we were gonna go out and find the guy who hadn&apos;t followed trail as</div><div>it was....

Some</div><div>ol&apos; biddy came out and started telling us we couldn&apos;t be there because</div><div>it was private property... we glanced around for signs denoting it as</div><div>such, cameras that would record us, and anything that might give us</div><div>the inkling that we couldn&apos;t be there.... There was none so we smiled</div><div>and continued out activities. This was Just John&apos;s virgin haring but</div><div>he obviously had hared already because the flour on his legs gave it</div><div>away. It was nice to see him in running clothes for once though!</div><div>Vaginger was freaking out between the lady saying she would call the</div><div>cops and how trail was going to be.... I just told her to relax, take a</div><div>deep breath, and let it happen... wait that sounded creepy. Either way</div><div>we had a great pack of visitors, the regulars, and even a Virgin! Just</div><div>Kelly-Beth works for a local university (not to be named!) for</div><div>admissions and owns a CrossFit Box on the side. She found out about us</div><div>from some friends who knows who had hashed overseas and looked us up</div><div>on the internet.

Beer</div><div>Check was in a nice secluded stream valley with themed drinks like</div><div>Margarita Mixers and Mexican Beer. Kudos to the hares for finding the</div><div>shiggy they could in the middle of downtown Fairfax! I&apos;m guessing it</div><div>was about 3.5 miles total, with some great checks that really stumped</div><div>the pack for a bit! Virginia once again showed me how hilly of a bitch</div><div>she can be! So we ran on into circle and proceeded to get loud and</div><div>rowdy as we violated each other and then closed out with some</div><div>namings!!!</div><div><br></div><div>NAMINGS!!!</div><div>It was time for a Double Header! (Head.. who said head?....) We were</div><div>able to get in the naming of both Just Just John and Just Austin .</div><div><br></div><div>Just John&apos;s Doctoral Degree is in theater and his dissertation was on</div><div>the use of Zombies on the American stage. He also is known for having</div><div>&apos;relations&apos; on walker&apos;s trail..... there were other names but we decided</div><div>upon "The Walking Head".</div><div><br></div><div>Just Austin, a Hokie with a Doctorate in mathematics (Seriously how</div><div>are we attracting all these intellectuals to the hash?) who had a</div><div>dissertation that&apos;s title was so long even he couldn&apos;t remember it....</div><div>Anyway A few really good names came up including Texas Instruments ,</div><div>and my favorite, Reverse Polish Cowgirl, but in the end it was "Dr.</div><div>Cockulus".</div><div><br></div><div>So I can&apos;t recall who got the HashShit... or any other violations...

Can you guess which</div><div>direction AndHowsHerBush took us?</div><div><br></div><div>As trail dived directly into some pretty serious shiggy and took us up</div><div>and down the steep banks of Broad Run, the pack could be heard</div><div>uttering curses to the hare as he took us into the coming storm and</div><div>through some good thorns and prickers. We hooked north and came onto a</div><div>tunnel under Russell Branch Rd where we found our First Beer Check. We</div><div>didn&apos;t stop too long because the rain had gone from light drizzle to</div><div>big honkin drops. Meanwhile the pack enjoyed listening to</div><div>LongTimeNoSeer Otter shoot down Bad Dog&apos;s attempts at laying down the</div><div>mack... it never gets old! We made our way up to Route 7 and what we</div><div>thought went over... but trail was located in another tunnel with... MORE</div><div>Beer! The rain reaaaaaly started coming down hard so we hunkered down,</div><div>drank some more beer and drew obscene chalk markings on the roof of</div><div>the tunnel... pretty certain they won&apos;t wash away until the global</div><div>warming stuff happens and the entire area is submerged! After a good</div><div>long wait, MOST of us headed out to continue... we figured we needed to</div><div>get going before the whole trail was washed away. A series of tricky</div><div>checks along Bridgefield Way slowed us down but flour was found as we</div><div>wound our way through a subdivision. By now the rain had pretty much</div><div>stopped and we just enjoyed the mushy mud and puddles it left us! We</div><div>dashed back into the shiggy behind some apartments and then were once</div><div>again calling on-on to the confused apartment dwellers. All of sudden</div><div>I recognized our location... we had done a big damn circle and were back</div><div>at the tunnel under 7. A true Trail arrow pointed back towards the</div><div>tunnel but the pack wasn&apos;t convinced. I ventured through to check out</div><div>but realized no one could hear me over the sounds of the busy highway</div><div>so I used my high powered rape whistle to let them know what I had</div><div>found....

So</div><div>I grabbed another beer and waited for the pack to roll up before</div><div>heading out through the shiggy and into/across a field of waist high</div><div>grass back towards start. Luckily that kind of grass lends itself to</div><div>be easy to follow where the hare had been.. so I think my GPS tracked</div><div>the fastest part of the whole trail there. We burst out of the field</div><div>and across the commuter lot to start for a great finish to a nice 2.5</div><div>mile trail. AHHB did an outstanding job of giving us some good ol&apos;</div><div>SoHappy Shiggy, Hare tricks, and multiple opportunities for beer!</div><div>Thanks Old Man!

According to</div><div>the Directions we were to "Look for wankers milling around." Well</div><div>Parent&apos;s Weekend and I drove in and kept looking for Wankers... there</div><div>were plenty of kids and soccer milfs but no wankers. The park was in</div><div>full swing soccer mode this evening... we kept going, weaving through</div><div>the parking lot looking for the last hidden area, the usual hang out</div><div>of wankers. We found a little empty gravel lot behind a storage shed</div><div>and figured that was good enough. We found Little Cock there, soon</div><div>joined by ATWI and Rosary Bleeds. So now we had Wankers milling</div><div>around... it must be start! Then Doc drove up and said we were wrong...</div><div>Parent&apos;s pointed out that Little Cock has the beer therefor wherever</div><div>he was was right! Doc insisted though and we all drove back to the</div><div>entrance to a spot right along the main road in full sight of the</div><div>soccer games and parked next to an angry looking soccer mom (not a</div><div>milf) and waited for start. Said soccer mom didn&apos;t seem to enjoy the</div><div>loud, obnoxious and sometimes vulgar conversations that the</div><div>sausage-fest of pack was having so we toned it down for a minute then</div><div>forgot and got loud again. Needless to say, this hash seems to have</div><div>found itself lately in an on-again/off-again relationship with Mother</div><div>Nature. What I mean is every other week we have some craptastic</div><div>weather on Tuesday followed by gorgeous weather the next! Not to be</div><div>outdone by AndHowsHerBush&apos;s trail of two weeks ago Doc and Cheap Ass</div><div>Gigolo found a way to wrangle in more rain and bigger lightening this</div><div>week. Had trail chosen to go south we would have been scott-free as</div><div>the weather moved along north of us... but what fun would that have</div><div>been!</div><div><br></div><div>The Hares ran off and scared us right off the bat when Cheap Ass</div><div>Gigolo started asking Doc what the marks meant again! Later when we</div><div>headed out we bounded deeper into the park before crossing a little a</div><div>strip of shiggy and out into a power easement, heading southwest</div><div>towards a beautiful sunset filled sky... but as they say on VH1&apos;s behind</div><div>the music "And then things went sour".... we hit a false trail and had</div><div>to head north uphill with Armageddon happening before us. Lightening</div><div>and rain was easily seen and heard falling not on us, but where we</div><div>were headed. We clipped back into the woods for bit slowed down by</div><div>some logs and curious placement of flour. As we reached the edge of</div><div>the woods on the Fairfax County Parkway the heavy drops of thunderous</div><div>rain pelted us as we broke the tree line. Off we tore being very very</div><div>f&apos;in careful across the parkway and into the power line easement.</div><div>Thoroughly soaked and not even a mile in, we dodged lightning strikes</div><div>that boomed just moments after flashing (always a good sign right??)</div><div>while we attempted to find rapidly dissolving flour. We continued for</div><div>over a mile over a few creeks that crossed the easement and through</div><div>some checks that slowed us up momentarily before ducking back into the</div><div>woods at Middle Run Park, I enjoyed the brief respite from immediate</div><div>electrical death, but the rain was still coming down hard under the</div><div>canopy. Trail took us along Cherry run and we were delighted to find a</div><div>bucket of beers inside a tunnel. As it seemed safer for the moment</div><div>inside the tunnel we stopped and waited for the pack to catch up. They</div><div>didn&apos;t really though... and we figured they had ditched trail to head</div><div>back to start or shortcutted so after several moments (and a hare</div><div>sighting at the end of the long tunnel) we took off through the tunnel</div><div>and down along the creekside. The hare really tricked us up by doing a</div><div>giant swirly loop on us against the backs of trees. We then caught him</div><div>and realized he had lost himself trying to relay flour and ran with us</div><div>out of the park and into a neighborhood before dropping us back into</div><div>some pretty extreme shiggy along Peyton run till we finally caught up</div><div>with Cheap Ass Gigolo! We had just done a mile and half loop to a spot</div><div>only a few hundred feet away from where we caught Doc so he could give</div><div>CAG chance to finish laying to beer check.... Drat you Wiley hares!!!</div><div>But it was some great shiggy so I couldn&apos;t be too mad. We came upon</div><div>the second beer check which was in a tunnel underneath Huntsman Blvd</div><div>and let the hares run off to finish trail. We had beer, the rain had</div><div>let up, what else was there to do.... But as we sat drinking the beers,</div><div>we started noticing the water level was rising, and pretty rapidly as</div><div>all the runoff from the entire area made its way through where we were</div><div>standing to Huntsman Lake on the other side of the tunnel!! Since ATWI</div><div>doesn&apos;t do beer, he was content to start tearing apart the beaver dam</div><div>and aid the rushing water as it continued continue to grow. Parent&apos;s</div><div>Weekend kept trying to convince me to slide on my ass to the end of</div><div>the tunnel as the current was getting pretty strong, but after a big</div><div>ass log careened past us on the rapids and the beer bucket almost</div><div>washed away we decided it was time to move on! Trail crossed over the</div><div>road and down into the dried out (kinda) lakebed of Huntsman Lake.... It</div><div>was pretty mushy and you had to really try to find the more solid</div><div>spots to avoid going knee deep, I&apos;m pretty sure I heard PW bite it but</div><div>I was too busy fending for myself to look back. We ringed the SE</div><div>corner of the lake and popped up a hill onto a trail that brought back</div><div>to the parkway where the rain was picking up again. From here on out,</div><div>trail basically headed west along the parkway and then into South Run</div><div>park back to start. The rain had caused all the soccer games to get</div><div>cancelled and the area was pretty empty, except for a group of wet,</div><div>muddy hashers gathered around a few vehicles! Apparently AHHB had</div><div>stopped by and bolted. Booo! I had a tally of about 5.2 miles over an</div><div>hour and half period. Despite the possibility of instant death from</div><div>the great god Zeus up in the clouds, confused hares, and quickly</div><div>dissipating flour, the trail was a great shiggariffic tour of the</div><div>area. Some fun conversations were held at the beer check and I&apos;m</div><div>surprised none of us got hurt! We had a quick but sweet circle, mainly</div><div>due to Bad Dog wanting to violate everyone!</div><div><br></div><div>Violations!</div><div><br></div><div>FRB: Rosary Bleeds</div><div>FBI: Taster&apos;s Choice (somebody had to be it.. and I had the nicest legs)</div><div>DFL: Bad Dog</div><div><br></div><div>Returners:</div><div>Amber Alert</div><div><br></div><div>ATWI - For renaming Iowatchin&apos; to Ohionation on last week&apos;s signup!</div><div>Hares - for making a female unfriendly hash</div><div>Hares - for passing by all the nice tree bark and using puddles to</div><div>place their flour for trail!</div><div>Parents Weekend RA - cause the weather sucks</div><div>ATWI - for Pounding beaver (dams) on trail</div><div>Hares - for putting beer check in flood zones</div><div>Rosary Bleeds - for doing 9 trails in 6 days and still not knowing any</div><div>hash songs!</div><div><br></div><div>And to Bad Dog&apos;s credit he did run the trail with Mt Vernon&apos;s Hashit</div><div>if anyone out there was wondering!</div><div>See you at our Tour Du Hash trail on 10 June!

That chocolate milk is organic gold, you can&apos;t just give it away. But you know who you never run into again? All the girls that you realized you had crushes on but were too busy being in denial. I&apos;ve been patiently waiting to suggest having "an old school sleepover party, just like old times" for the last TEN YEARS. Maybe one day, Jennifer, maybe one day...</span></p><div class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline; color: rgb(20, 24, 35); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.32px;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6px;">We got to trail start - it was nice weather, we had a good crowd. Lush has a sister she doesn&apos;t know about, and the sister was there and even provided the venue for beer check. I made a note of the address so we can go back and sneak in the hot tub/live in the garage for a while. We ran through a graveyard and I&apos;m pretty sure we&apos;re all haunted now. We ran around a high school and I did some hurdles, just like in high school, but I didn&apos;t eat shit this time. Trail ended at Milf&apos;s house and ATWI and Milf supplied us with an array of good food to shove into my mouth. We may have scared away another one of Milf&apos;s Au Pair&apos;s, so I would say it was successful trail.</p><p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">Some violations happened, but I don&apos;t remember any of them. Parents Weakend got the hashit because he&apos;s about to have a child and will probably disappear from hashing for a while. Obviously, his priorities are just not in the right place. More importantly, we all gathered around to tell ATWI how much we don&apos;t appreciate all of his shiggy trails, his willingness to always lend a helping hand, all of the good food he cooks for us, his sexual generosity, his hashing wisdom and knowledge, all of his songs, and blah blah blah. I mean, how pretentious can someone be?</p><p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">While I&apos;ve only been with S.H.I.T for the last year, most can speak at length about ATWI&apos;s awesomeness/awfulness much better than I. I&apos;m sure we will run into him sometime in the future, just like those in your graduating class that never go away. For those that regret their missed opportunity to experience ATWI&apos;s sexual healing ...you will never see him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">"See you in hell, ATWI!"</p></div>', ''),
